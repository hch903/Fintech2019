  "topic": "What\u2019s Working In Smart Beta ETFs",
  "parag": "Not too long ago, smart-beta ETFs were the focus of all the hype in an industry fascinated with the new and novel ways ETF issuers were slicing and dicing the market.A little less long ago, some naysayers started to say smart beta had had its day, as investors returned their attention to cheap, easy-to-understand and easy-to-implement core beta strategies. No bells and whistles required. \u00a0In reality, as a segment, smart-beta ETFs find themselves somewhere in the middle\u2014neither the hottest new thing in town, nor obsolete and forgotten.From the get-go, complexity and, traditionally, a higher price tag, have been head winds for adoption of these strategies. This is still true today, especially in an ETF market where fee compression is inching closer and closer to zero.New Launches, Outsized GrowthBut smart-beta ETFs keep on coming, and some keep on growing at an impressive rate. In the past 12 months (as of late February), 77 new smart-beta ETFs came to market\u2014or roughly a third of all ETFs launched in the past year, according to FactSet data. There are more than 1,000 smart-beta ETFs on the market today.What\u2019s more, asset growth in this segment outpaced the broader ETF market as well as vanilla ETF asset growth on a percentage basis in the past year. While vanilla funds saw total assets under management (AUM) grow 4.3% in the time period, smart-beta fund assets grew 10.9%, according to FactSet data. Today smart-beta ETFs command $880 billion in total combined assets. \u00a0\u201cThe past 12 months have been good for \u2018smart beta,\u2019 in contrast to its below-market growth rate in 2016 and 2017,\u201d FactSet's Director of ETF Research Elisabeth Kashner said. \u201cSPY was the elephant in the room, losing over $20 billion in outflows during the period, thereby lowering the growth rates for vanilla funds. Massive liquidity cuts both ways.\u201d\u00a0Factors Working In SpaceThe biggest smart-beta ETF in the market today is the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV), with $47 billion in total AUM.As a factor, value has been a \u201cwinner\u201d in recent months, Kashner says, and VTV has dominated that corner of the market. Not only is this fund huge, it keeps growing. In 12 months, VTV grew from a $37 billion ETF to a $46 billion fund.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf the specific strategies that started the time period with $10 billion or more in AUM, winners were value, multifactor, fundamental and low volatility,\u201d Kashner added.After a dip late in 2018, VTV is now up 11.7% so far in 2019.Other Winning FactorsAnother segment that has been resonating with investors in the past year is low volatility, and no ETF comes even close to the iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol U.S.A. ETF (USMV) in this space.The fund has been hugely popular with investors in the past year, attracting flows of $8 billion in 12 months, and today boasts more than $25 billion in total AUM. USMV is today the largest-largest smart-beta ETF on the market. By comparison, close competitor Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) saw $2 billion in net asset inflows in the same March-March period, and today has $10.1 billion in total assets.USMV is up about 12% year-to-date, and has rallied almost 13% in the past 12 months. \u00a0\u00a0Multifactor WinnersOn the multifactor front, two smaller ETFs have stood out in the past year with impressive growth: the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (GSLC) and the Hartford Multifactor Developed Markets (ex-US) ETF (RODM), Kashner notes.GSLC grew nearly 65% in size, going from $2.9 billion in total AUM in March 2018 to $4.5 billion a year later. RODM, meanwhile, has seen sevenfold growth, hitting more than $1.8 billion in total AUM today\u2014up from only $280 million 12 months ago.Both of these ETFs have had a good run year-to-date, posting double-digit gains\u2014although RODM remains down 2.5% on an annual basis.\u00a0\u00a0Fundamental WinnersFinally, among fundamental ETFs, two funds deserve a closer look, each practically doubling in size in the past year, according to FactSet data.\u00a0The iShares Edge MSCI U.S.A. Quality Factor ETF (QUAL) neared $10 billion in assets by March 2019\u2014up from $4.5 billion a year earlier\u2014while the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO) grew to $6.1 billion in total assets in 12 months.Year-to-date, both strategies have delivered double-digit returns, with QUAL now up more than 17% in 2019, and DGRO up 12.7%. Like other equity strategies, these ETFs too faced a dip in late 2018.\u00a0Charts courtesy of StockCharts.com\u00a0What\u2019s Working In Smart BetaAt the end of the day, beyond specific factors or pockets of smart-beta ETFs that resonate with investors at any given time, two key trends are driving smart-beta ETF asset growth.The first has nothing to do with innovation, but everything to do with cost. \u00a0\u201cWhat caught my eye in this space [in the past year] was not inventiveness in repacking stocks, but the appeal of the cheapest funds,\u201d Kashner said. \u201cStrategic funds with expense ratios of 0.10% or less took in $34.5 billion; the 0.11-0.20% group took in $23 billion; 0.21-0.30% took in $17.3 billion; but only $2.8 billion went to funds charging more than 0.30%.\u201d\u00a0VTV, the biggest smart-beta ETF on the market today, has a price tag of 0.05%. Investors are paying $5 per $10,000 invested for this massive, hugely liquid smart-beta ETF that trades at pennywide spreads. VTV is not only cheap for smart beta, it\u2019s cheap for an ETF in general.\u00a0Costlier Funds Still Relatively CheapThe iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF) and the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) aren\u2019t that far behind VTV, with $43 billion and $38 billion in total AUM, respectively. They cost significantly more, at 0.20% in expense ratio each, but that\u2019s still less than most smart-beta strategies.Rounding out the top five smart-beta funds in terms of size, the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) reached $37 billion in total AUM in the past year, while the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) is today the fifth-largest smart-beta ETF, with $33 billion in assets. VUG also costs only 0.05% and VIG costs 0.08%, or $8 per $10,000 invested.Clearly iShares and Vanguard dominate the space in assets\u2014much like they do in other asset classes and segments of the ETF market. Cost is no doubt a big part of it.But keeping a lid on cost is also helping relatively younger, smaller players like Goldman Sachs find traction. Consider that GSLC, one of the smart-beta ETFs from Goldman\u2019s ActiveBeta lineup that has found strong following, costs only 0.09%\u2014or $9 per $10,000 invested.The second thing to note is that smart-beta asset growth is also driven by a trend in the ETF space known as \u201cbring your own assets,\u201d Kashner says. Outside of iShares\u2019 and Vanguard\u2019s massive success in the space, and outside of ultra-low-cost strategies, newer issuers that are backing their proprietary ETFs with their own clients\u2019 money have also found success in getting traction in the space. Note for example that Goldman is one of the top shareholders in GSLC.If it\u2019s indeed true that assets beget assets, BYOA is as smart a strategy to get a new smart-beta fund going in an ever-crowding segment as any other, and some issuers are finding it a winning strategy.\u00a0Contact Cinthia Murphy at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "ETF Of The Week: Small Cap China Fund Shines",
  "parag": "Lately, China equities have been on a tear. Buoyed by investor optimism over thawing U.S.-China relations, the CSI 300 Index, a benchmark of the 300 largest stocks trading in Shenzhen and Shanghai, rallied 29% in the first quarter of the year. On Thursday, the index struck a one-year high.So it's probably no surprise that 12 of the top-20-best-performing ETFs so far of 2019 are China equity ETFs, including many small- to midcap ETFs or narrow sector funds (read: \"Top Performing ETFs Of The Year\").The best-performing among these is the $38 million VanEck Vectors ChinaAMC SME-ChiNext ETF (CNXT). Year-to-date, CNXT has risen an eye-popping 44%, nearly triple the rise seen in U.S. blue chips:\u00a0Source: StockCharts.com. Date range: Jan. 1, 2019 \u2013 April 4, 2019.\u00a0Under CNXT's HoodCNXT tracks 100 of the largest and most liquid stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange's SME and ChiNext boards; the SME board focuses on small- and medium-cap enterprises, while ChiNext is a Nasdaq-style board geared toward fast-growing stocks.As a result, CNXT's benchmark tilts toward smaller stocks and startups. Unlike many other Chinese equity ETFs, which are dominated by financials, 29% of CNXT is allocated to tech stocks, while consumer cyclicals and noncyclicals together comprise another 22%.About A-SharesCNXT is one of a next-gen iteration of Chinese equity funds called \"RQFII ETFs,\" which directly hold mainland-listed A-shares via a complex quota system.Older Chinese ETFs, meanwhile, hold either derivatives or shares of China companies listed on external stock exchanges, such as Hong Kong's. (For more on how China share classes work, read the \"Definitive China ETF Guide.\")Until recently, A-shares were relatively off-limits to foreign investors. Lately, however, China has taken steps to increase access to these domestic, renminbi-quoted stocks. Last May, MSCI even added A-shares to its indices; FTSE Russell will follow suit this summer (read: \"Coming To An ETF Near You: China A-Shares\").That has perhaps dulled some of the potential impact CNXT and other similar ETFs might have had on the market. Their ability to access A-shares has become less of a distinguishing factor than it once was.Small But MightyDespite its gangbuster performance, CNXT remains small and thinly traded. The fund averages about $1.4 million in daily trading volume, with a spread of 0.17%. Meanwhile, the largest Chinese ETF, the $6.3 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI), averages about $1.3 billion with a 0.02% spread.Still, at a price point of 0.65%, CXNT is among the cheaper pure-play A-shares ETFs, and its 2019 returns to-date remain compelling, helping it to stand out among an already-above-average field.What's more, should a U.S.-China trade deal materialize, as seems increasingly likely, then Chinese stocks\u2014and CNXT\u2014will likely rise even higher.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "parag": "A tumultuous end to 2018 didn\u2019t carry over into 2019. So far this year, it\u2019s been smooth sailing for global stocks, as the MSCI ACWI Index surged by 12.3% during the first quarter.It was the best quarter for the index\u2014which tracks developed and emerging market stocks\u2014since the third quarter of 2010. U.S. stocks, as measured by the S&P 500, did even better, rising 13.6% for their best quarterly showing since 2009\u2019s third quarter.Granted, global stock markets are still off their highs from last year, but investors are no doubt reassured by the fact that equities have climbed so strongly in the face of ongoing concerns about sliding earnings, slowing economic growth, trade wars and Brexit.Pot On Top The best showing for global stocks in nearly a decade boded well for exchange-traded funds. Many ETFs registered sizzling gains during the first three months of the year, including four leveraged products that more than doubled.We\u2019ll get to those later, but first we\u2019ll run down the top-performing ETFs of the year that delivered their gains without using leverage of any kind. Inverse products are also excluded from this list.\n\u00a0Top Performing ETFs Of The Year (excluding leveraged/inverse)Note: Data measures total returns for the year-to-date period through March 29.\u00a0Easily taking the No. 1 position is the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ). The only U.S.-listed ETF focused on cannabis stocks, investors holding the fund in Q1 were rewarded with a whopping 46.3% gain.The marijuana ETF is notoriously volatile. The Q1 surge only puts it back to where it was trading last October.China ETFs Dominate MJ may have been the top-performing ETF of the first quarter, but another group of funds was arguably more dominant. Consider this: Of the top 20 funds of the year, 12 are China-related, and each has gains of more than 28.5%.It\u2019s no secret 2018 was a horrible year for Chinese stocks. Down nearly a third from peak to trough, all seemed dire for the country\u2019s equities as recently as December. Economic growth was rapidly slowing and a full-blown trade war with the U.S. was raging.But just as quickly as they fell, Chinese stocks rebounded. During the first quarter of 2019, investors grew increasingly confident that the U.S. and China would strike a deal to end their trade war. That deal has yet to be finalized, but most people remain optimistic that it\u2019s coming soon.Stimulus measures from the Chinese government also raised hopes that the slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy could be managed.Of course, China isn\u2019t out of the woods yet and risks remain. But at least for now, investors are choosing to see the glass as half full for the country and its stock market. Funds like the VanEck Vectors ChinaAMC SME-ChiNext ETF (CNXT), the Xtrackers Harvest CSI 500 China A-Shares Small Cap ETF (ASHS) and the Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy China ETF (BCNA) are among the top-performing China ETFs so far this year.Biotech & Oil ETFsOutside of marijuana and China, other ETFs working well this year are a pair of health care funds, a trio of crude oil ETPs and one IPO product.The ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) and the ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (SBIO) are the outperforming health care funds. Both products are heavily weighted in biotech stocks, which have outperformed this year, even as the broader health care sector has lagged the S&P 500.Meanwhile, the United States Oil Fund (USO), the ETRACS S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OILX) and the Credit Suisse X-Links Crude Oil Shares Covered Call ETN (USOI) are oil-tracking products that have delivered handsome gains this year as crude oil prices rallied.Starting in January, the oil cartel OPEC cut production to tighten the market and lift oil prices. So far, the move has paid off.Leveraged Oil ETPs Double As promised, we\u2019ll now take a look at the list of top-performing ETFs of the year that includes leveraged and inverse funds. Including the more volatile leveraged and inverse products results in a completely different set of names, headlined by the VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETN (UWT) and its 103.2% return.Several other crude oil products joins that ETN among the top 20.

  "topic": "And The 2018 ETF.com Awards Winners Are \u2026",
  "parag": "The sixth annual ETF.com Awards Thursday night in New York City honored products, people and companies that made a difference in the ETF industry in 2018. The 30 categories recognize everything from new funds to established products, as well as the issuers, service providers and end users who make the industry go round.ETFGI's founder and managing partner Deborah Fuhr took home the Lifetime Achievement Award.For more than 20 years, Fuhr has been one of the world's foremost experts on ETFs, delivering in-depth, comprehensive insight sought by fund issuers, investors, institutions and asset managers alike. When she\u2019s not amassing and analyzing data on the global ETP market, she\u2019s also advocating on behalf of greater gender diversity in the industry via Women in ETFs, the mentorship and networking organization she helped found.\"I love taking on new things that force you to learn something new,\" said Fuhr. \"The landscape is changing so quickly, and data is very important. Providing good data and insights is key. I\u2019m hopeful there\u2019s still a lot more to come.\"Fuhr faced off against some of the most important movers and shakers in the industry:It was also a good night for J.P. Morgan, which took home three awards for its JPMorgan BetaBuilders Japan ETF (BBJP): ETF Of The Year, Best New ETF and Best New International/Global Equity ETF.The fund, which provides low-cost, market-cap-weighted exposure to Japanese equities, isn't exciting in and of itself. But the sheer speed at which BBJP grew its assets blew everyone away: Within a month's time, BBJP had accumulated more than $1 billion in assets under management, making it the second-fastest U.S. ETF ever to hit the billion-dollar club.Much of those assets came from J.P. Morgan's existing client base, in a \"bring your own assets\" approach that has become ETFs' latest defining trend. As of March 22, 2019, BBJP racked up an impressive $3.3 billion in assets.The three sets of finalists are as follows:\u00a0ETF Of The YearBest New ETFBest New International/Global Equity ETFHere\u2019s a rundown of this year\u2019s other awards\u2026Most Innovative New ETF: Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF (BDRY); Innovator S&P 500 Buffer ETFs (Series) (BJUL) (TIE)Awarded to the most groundbreaking and disruptive ETF launched in 2018. This is an ETF that is pushing the envelope in terms of what kinds of exposures can be packaged into an ETF.Innovation in ETFs can come in many forms, and in 2018, it came in the form of new and novel access from two radically different ETFs.The Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF (BDRY), which tracks dry bulk freight futures, now allows any investor with a brokerage account to access a key commodity market segment that, until now, has mostly been off-limits. (Dry bulk freight refers to the transportation of dry cargo such as grain and iron ore.)Meanwhile, the Innovator S&P 500 Buffer ETF - July (BJUL)\u2014the first in a series of similar ETFs\u2014is an actively managed fund that offers access to the price return of the S&P 500, while capping gains and limiting potential losses in a so-called buffer strategy. What makes BJUL and this entire series innovative is the extensive use of FLEX options to deliver a defined outcome in a way only previously available in structured products and annuities.Finalists included:\u00a0Best New U.S. Equity ETF: Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV)Awarded to the most important U.S. equity ETF launched in 2018.Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing is a snowball teetering on top of a mountain, and in 2018, Vanguard gave it a big push with the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV). ESGV offers socially responsible investing in a uniquely Vanguard package. With over 1,500 stocks, the ETF boasts broad diversification at a price point of just 0.12%, making ESGV (at the time of its launch) the cheapest ESG U.S. equity ETF on the market, and one of the cheaper total U.S. market ETFs, period.The result is a dirt-cheap total market fund with performance nearly identical to that of the much bigger Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), but without any of the stocks that give ESG-minded investors pause. So rather than having to choose between principles and performance, investors could use ESGV as a replacement for some or all of their existing VTI allocation, headache-free. If anybody could make ESG investing go mainstream, it\u2019s Vanguard, so we\u2019re eager to see if ESGV lives up to that potential.Finalists included:\u00a0Best New U.S. Fixed-Income ETF: iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (EAGG)Awarded to the most important fixed-income ETF launched in 2018.Though environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing options are increasing in the equity space, among fixed-income ETFs, they remain relatively rare. That's what makes the iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (EAGG) so attractive: It's an ESG take on the famous, broad-based Bloomberg Barclays U.S Aggregate Bond Index (the \"Agg\"). Bonds of corporations and other institutions are weighted based on their ESG score, and bonds of tobacco and weapons companies are excluded. EAGG optimizes its holdings to maintain marketlike exposure to the investment-grade bond space, giving investors the ability to support ESG causes in their fixed-income portfolio without deviating too much from their market. And it all comes at just 0.10%.Finalists included:\u00a0Best New International/Global Fixed-Income ETF: Vanguard Total World Bond ETF (BNDW)Awarded to the most important international or global fixed-income ETF launched in 2018.Vanguard knows bonds: It launched the first bond index fund all the way back in 1986, entering an asset class that had been the sole purview of active managers. And while the Vanguard Total World Bond ETF (BNDW) may not be as revolutionary as the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund was 33 years ago, BNDW still deserves praise for providing investors with exceptionally low-cost exposure to the global investment-grade bond market.BNDW gets its exposure by holding two other Vanguard ETFs, the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), a U.S. investment-grade bond ETF, and the Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX), an ex-U.S. investment-grade bond ETF. It doesn\u2019t charge anything extra on top of the fees for those two funds, meaning investors get to hold the equivalent of nearly 13,000 bonds across the globe for a mere 0.09% per year.Finalists included:\u00a0Best New Commodity ETF: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF (CMDY)Awarded to the most important commodity ETF launched in 2018.The iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF (CMDY) doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does a lot of good things very well. For starters, it offers broad commodity exposure, holding futures contracts for 20 commodities across the agriculture, energy and metals sectors, and weighting commodities by production and liquidity. Secondly, it is designed to reduce the costs of holding those futures, by selecting contracts specifically to minimize contango and maximize backwardation. Thirdly, it forgoes the annual Schedule K-1 form, which can lead to tax headaches for investors; instead, CMDY is structured as an open-ended ETF, on which investors pay the usual long- and short-term capital gains rates. Finally, at 0.28%, it's one of the cheapest broad-based commodity ETFs around.Finalists included:\u00a0Best New Alternatives ETF: VanEck Vectors Real Asset Allocation ETF (RAAX)Awarded to the most important alternatives ETF launched in 2018.Real assets, though often volatile, are often touted as good portfolio diversifiers, as well as great for hedging against rising inflation. The actively managed VanEck Vectors Real Asset Allocation ETF (RAAX) delivers a broad mix of real assets, investing in ETFs with exposure to REITs, commodities, natural resource equities, MLPs, infrastructure and more.What sets RAAX apart is its laser focus on defense: The fund is designed with downside risk management and lower volatility in mind. To that end, the portfolio manager turns to various technical, sentiment and macro indicators to make allocation decisions across various assets, looking for those assets with better expected returns. Those allocation decisions include the ability to move the portfolio up to 100% into cash or cash equivalents when market turbulence picks up, and downside protection becomes more important.Finalists included:\u00a0Best New Asset Allocation ETF: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund (NTSX)Awarded to the most important ETF launched in 2018 that combines exposure to multiple asset classes.The WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund (NTSX) is an actively managed portfolio that uses futures contracts to construct what is effectively a leveraged 60/40 portfolio of U.S. equities and Treasuries. The fund places 90% of its assets in U.S. equities and the remaining 10% in Treasury futures contracts, the notional exposure of which equals 60% of the fund's assets. The resulting exposure is then equivalent to a 90/60 allocation to stocks and Treasuries, or a 60/40 allocation, leveraged 150%. As such, the strategy offers leverage in a controlled way, and the fund has effectively navigated a tricky three-month market window, outperforming both the S&P 500 Index and Treasuries. Better yet, this sophisticated strategy comes cheap, costing just 0.20%.Finalists included:Best New Smart-Beta or Factor ETF: iShares Evolved U.S. Sector ETFs (Series) (IECS)Awarded to the most important new ETF launched in 2018, regardless of asset class, that uses a quantitative, research-driven approach to attempt to deliver superior long-term risk-adjusted returns.Artificial intelligence (AI) is at the core of what makes the iShares Evolved U.S. Sector ETFs the best in smart-beta innovation in 2018. The Evolved sector series includes seven different funds in all\u2014the iShares Evolved U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (IECS) is a mere representative of the entire series for the purpose of this award.With the use of AI\u2014including machine learning, natural language processing and text analysis\u2014iShares sifts through big data to group similar companies based on key business drivers; any given company may fall into more than one sector portfolio in the Evolved series, and is weighted accordingly. As such, the suite tackles the reality that, in today\u2019s highly connected economy, some companies may fit in more than one traditional GICS sector classification. The Evolved ETFs offer a new way to slice and dice sectors that are dynamic and ever-changing\u2014and for just 0.18% apiece.Finalists included:\u00a0Best New Active ETF: Vanguard U.S. Multifactor ETF (VFMF)Awarded to the most important new actively managed ETF launched in 2018, regardless of asset class.Despite being known for its pioneering index funds, Vanguard has a long history in active management. Until recently, however, it hadn't launched any actively managed ETFs. So it was big news when the issuer rolled out its first suite of active ETFs in February 2018. The largest of these is the Vanguard U.S. Multifactor ETF (VFMF), which invests in U.S. equities exhibiting value, momentum, quality and low-volatility characteristics. It offers Vanguard's signature broad diversification, selecting holdings across the size spectrum and evaluating them based on a quantitative model. Best of all, VFMF is extremely low-cost, with an expense ratio of just 0.18%. Only a handful of active U.S. stock ETFs come cheaper, most of which are Vanguard's own single-factor funds.Finalists included:\u00a0Best New ESG ETF: Goldman Sachs JUST U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (JUST)Awarded to the most important ESG ETF launched in 2018.In an increasingly \u201cgreenwashed\u201d field of ESG funds that are socially responsible in name only, the Goldman Sachs JUST U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (JUST) attempts to truly capture investors\u2019 priorities. The fund\u2019s benchmark starts with a series of public opinion surveys, in which respondents identify the business practices that most matter to them\u2014everything from how companies treat their workers to the eco-friendliness of their supply chain. Large-cap stocks are then ranked and weighted by the behaviors most important to respondents, and the index is reconstituted each year based on that year\u2019s survey results. As such, JUST evolves as investors\u2019 concept of social justice changes, so that its portfolio always reflects whatever matters most to investors in the moment it matters most.Finalists included:\u00a0Thematic ETF of the Year: VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO); EventShares U.S. Policy Alpha ETF (PLCY) (TIE)Awarded to the most important \u201cthematic\u201d ETF of 2018, as measured by its ability to capture important macro plays that can lead to specific portfolio outcomes.There was a tie for Thematic ETF of the Year, with the VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO) and the EventShares U.S. Policy Alpha ETF (PLCY) each claiming the prize. Both funds are groundbreakers, in their own ways.ESPO, which tracks global video gaming companies, is the first ETF to include esports in that definition, including league operators, streaming services and platform providers. PLCY, meanwhile, is an actively managed fund that chooses its holdings based on how the companies will be affected by U.S. government regulations, trade policies and fiscal spending. Launched in 2017, PLCY was revamped in April 2018 to combine the objectives of three different funds that focused on policy from partisan and tax perspectives.Finalists included:ETF Issuer of the Year: J.P. Morgan Asset ManagementAwarded to the ETF issuer that has done the most to improve investor outcomes through product introductions, product performance, fund management, asset gathering, investor support and innovation in 2018.J.P. Morgan Asset Management's success story happened slowly, then all at once. After years of quietly building up an ETF presence, it punctuated 2018 with blockbuster flows into its plain-vanilla, low-cost \"BetaBuilders\" ETF suite. In less than a year, the five ETFs, which covered core asset allocation categories at a fraction of the cost of their competitors, had attracted more than $10 billion in new assets. As of March 1, 2019, the firm's total assets under management had grown to $26 billion.Costs matter, as does knowing there's a market for your products, making J.P. Morgan's \u201cETF Issuer of the Year\u201d a well-deserved win. We\u2019re looking forward to what\u2019s next from the company.Finalists included:\u00a0Most Innovative ETF Issuer of the Year: Impact Shares Awarded to the ETF provider that has launched the most innovative and groundbreaking ETFs in 2018.When it comes to impact investing, newcomer Impact Shares talks the talk and walks the walk. As the industry's first tax-exempt nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, Impact Shares donates 100% of its advisory fees back to the charities and nonprofit organizations it works with, less operating expenses and working capital. In this way, investors can provide twofold support to the causes they believe in, both through investing in the companies advancing each charity's targeted cause and spurring the cash donation of the management fees.So far, Impact Shares has partnered with the NAACP on its initial fund, the Impact Shares NAACP Minority Empowerment ETF (NACP); the YWCA on the Impact Shares YWCA Women\u2019s Empowerment ETF (WOMN); and the UN Capital Development Fund for the Impact Shares Sustainable Development Goals Global Equity ETF (SDGA).Finalists included:\u00a0New ETF Issuer of the Year: Defiance ETFsAwarded to the new ETF issuer that has done the most to improve investor outcomes through product introductions, product performance, fund management, investor support and innovation.As its name implies, 2018\u2019s ETF Issuer of the Year, Defiance ETFs, aims to disrupt. The firm's funds poke at themes that are cutting edge and that the big boys seem to be ignoring. The digital world morphs daily into new directions and themes, and Defiance recognizes this, launching ETFs to represent the hot new tech trend faster than established ETF players.In August, the firm debuted with its Defiance Future Tech ETF (AUGR), which tracks global virtual/augmented-reality-related companies; one month later, it followed up with its Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM), which invests in quantum computing companies. Then, in November, Defiance filed for seven more ETFs, including the Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG), which launched in March 2019.ETFs have been the No. 1 disruptor in the investment space for a while now; they could even be considered defiant, in some ways. In that respect, Defiance ETFs is keeping the tradition alive.Finalists included:\u00a0Index Provider of the Year: MSCIAwarded to the index provider that has done the most to improve investor outcomes through index introductions, research, advisor support and more in 2018.For more than 40 years, MSCI has excelled at developing, constructing and managing indices.

A powerhouse among index providers, MSCI casts a long shadow in the ETF space as well, counting more than 900 ETFs from myriad providers around the globe tied to one of its benchmarks.Finalists included:Index of the Year: WisdomTree U.S. Multifactor IndexAwarded to the index that has done the most to provide new ways of considering investment strategies, opportunities or ideas in 2018.The WisdomTree U.S. Multifactor Index offers a unique take on the growing field of multifactor benchmarks. This index scores the 800 largest U.S.-listed stocks based on a composite of two fundamental factors (value and quality) and two technical factors (momentum and correlation to the broader market), making it one of the only smart-beta ETFs to incorporate correlations into its selection process. The top 25% are then included in the benchmark, and weighted by overall factor score and the inverse of their 12-month volatility.The result is a benchmark that goes beyond the same old securities and sectors; instead, the WisdomTree U.S. Multifactor Index is heavy in software (14%), insurance (13%) and health equipment (10%). This index also underpins the $101 million WisdomTree U.S. Multifactor Fund (USMF).Finalists included:\u00a0ETF Liquidity Provider of the Year: Jane Street Awarded to the ETF liquidity provider (including market maker, authorized participant, agency broker, etc.) that has done the most to improve investor outcomes through education, support, services, innovation and outreach.Liquidity providers play a vital role in the ETF ecosystem, enabling buyers and sellers find each other in the most efficient way possible.

This year\u2019s winner, Stradley Ronon, has plenty of practical expertise in doing just that. Led by the highly visible and universally respected Michael Mundt, Stradley Ronon\u2019s work spans all the major issues facing the ETF market today, from helping active managers enter the space to working with the innovators behind several proposed nontransparent structures. Look at the industry\u2019s biggest news stories, and you'll often find Stradley Ronon in the middle of them, such as client Invesco\u2019s acquisition of Oppenheimer\u2019s and Guggenheim\u2019s ETF businesses.\u00a0Finalists included:\u00a0ETF Ticker of the Year: ProShares Pet Care ETF (PAWZ)Awarded to the ETF with the best new ETF ticker.

ESPO offers diversified exposure to the next generation of digital entertainment, all for the relatively low price of 0.55%.

  "topic": "Research Affiliates: The Flattening Yield Curve",
  "parag": "Cam Harvey looks at the yield curve today through the lens of his 1986 pioneering work on yield-curve inversions and their foreshadowing of economic downturns.Jim Masturzo:\u00a0Over the past few months, there has been considerable discussion about the flattening US yield curve. We\u2019ll be talking about what this trend indicates and what it means for investors. Cam, in 1986, you pioneered work that demonstrated the shape of the yield curve foreshadows economic downturns. What did that work entail?Cam Harvey:\u00a0That early work was actually my dissertation at the University of Chicago, and I published a paper on the same topic in 1988*. My research looked at the cyclical properties of the slope of the yield curve, which is the difference between a long-term US Treasury yield and a short-term US Treasury yield. Typically, the long-term Treasury has a higher yield than the short-term Treasury, but in certain situations this relationship is inverted, so that the short rate is higher than the long rate. I found that an inverted yield curve was bad news for the economy, foreshadowing a recession.Jim:\u00a0And how has it done since then, out of sample since 1988?Cam:\u00a0As a researcher, you're often disappointed because your findings get weaker after publication. But surprisingly, in the four recessions that followed my dissertation, the yield curve inverted before every single one of them, including the global financial crisis, and also\u2014and this is surprising too\u2014it hasn\u2019t provided any false signals so far.Jim:\u00a0So far. And so one story for this could be that the Fed increases short rates and it slows down the economy too much. Is that the rationale, or are there other stories behind this?Cam:\u00a0In my 1986 dissertation, I posited a fairly simple theory that interest rates have two components: an inflation (or nominal) component and a real component. The real component is linked to real economic growth. Whenever the real return over the longer horizon is less than over the shorter horizon, it's bad news for growth, and we can anticipate that the US economy is going to slow down. The evidence is supportive of that.Jim:\u00a0So, as we know, the Fed has been doing quantitative easing over the last five to eight years, and they've bought a lot of longer-term debt, which has potentially pushed down interest rates. Do you think, under these circumstances, that an inversion could be a false signal this time?Cam:\u00a0You make a very good point that although this indicator has worked in the past, maybe it won't work in the future because of Fed intervention. It\u2019s possible. I will say that the history of Fed intervention is actually a long history. Indeed, part of the quantitative easing was the so-called Operation Twist, but the original Operation Twist was in the mid-1960s, so in a way the Fed has a long tradition of intervening in this market. I would actually argue that the Fed interventions were more effective earlier in the sample, because the markets have gotten so big now. Even with all of these interventions since the 1960s, we still have an accurate predictor and no false signals yet.Jim:\u00a0In 1986 when you were doing this work, you were the only person, or potentially one of only a few folks, looking at this relationship. Today, talk of an inverted curve is all over the news. Do you think a potential or developing inversion could be a case of investors preparing for future downturns, and even be a reinforcement mechanism, so if investors think things are going to turn bad, therefore they will?Cam:\u00a0Yes, the so-called self-fulfilling prophecy is a possibility here. Again, the track record of the indicator is pretty good. We don't know if it is going to work in the future, but there\u2019s no structural reason to think the indicator is broken. We do know other things, such as that the business cycle has become much less volatile. That observation is potentially consistent with the idea that investors are getting better at looking at these indicators and making adjustments that effectively smooth out the fluctuations in the business cycle. Indeed, during the global financial crisis 10 years ago, the drawdown in GDP was less than 5%. That is much less volatile than what we've experienced historically.Jim:\u00a0When the yield curve inverts, it doesn't necessarily mean recession tomorrow or next week. There is some amount of lag. So, in your work, how long is that lag? What is the variation in that?Cam:\u00a0In my research, the lag is usually 12 to 18 months. That's the lead time before a recession. I also looked at other indicators like the stock market, and the stock market is famous for giving false signals. The best false signal was Black Monday in 1987, a dramatic decrease in the stock market. People said, \u201cWell it's going to be a recession in 1988.\u201d But the yield curve was positively sloped and I said, \u201cNo, it's going to be 4% growth or more.\u201d My forecast was an outlier among professional forecasters, but it turned out that my prediction was pretty close to being realized at 4+% growth. So be careful of the stock market. It's all over the place. You make an excellent point about timing. Even though a recession might be within the next year and a half, it's still possible the stock market could continue to rise leading up to that recession.Jim:\u00a0And as I read about, or hear pundits talk about, the yield curve and inversion, there are always arguments about whether it\u2019s the 5-year/2-year slope, 10-year/3-month, 10-year/2-year, you know, pick your slope. What have you found?Cam:\u00a0I think we need to go with the original research. In 1986, I looked at two parts of the yield curve, the 5-year note minus the 3-month bill, and the 10-year bond minus the 3-month bill. The crucial thing is to use a very short-term interest rate. Those two yield spreads are highly correlated. I get nervous when I see people talking about the 10-year minus the 2-year. I got all these emails last week about the 5-year minus the 3-year inverting, saying \u201cHappy Yield-Curve Inversion Day!\u201d An investor can data mine to find a piece of the yield curve\u2014maybe it's the 11\u00bd-year minus the 7\u00be-year\u2014that has an inversion. That doesn't mean anything. I think we need to go with the original un-data-mined theory, which is based on a longer-term rate and a 3-month rate, and the inversion importantly needs to last for a quarter. If it's a day, so what? GDP is measured quarterly, so we need to measure this quarterly also.Jim:\u00a0This is very helpful. Thank you. To reiterate and summarize, we should be looking at the long-term rate versus the short-term rate, and understand that the slope should stay inverted for at least a quarter, and that the recession that follows might be down the road multiple quarters, or even a year or more.Cam:\u00a0That's correct.\u00a0Endnote:Harvey, Campbell. 1988.\u00a0\u201cThe Real Term Structure and Consumption Growth.\u201d Available at SSRN."

The best false signal was Black Monday in 1987, a dramatic decrease in the stock market. People said, \u201cWell it's going to be a recession in 1988.\u201d But the yield curve was positively sloped and I said, \u201cNo, it's going to be 4% growth or more.\u201d My forecast was an outlier among professional forecasters, but it turned out that my prediction was pretty close to being realized at 4+% growth. So be careful of the stock market. It's all over the place. You make an excellent point about timing. Even though a recession might be within the next year and a half, it's still possible the stock market could continue to rise leading up to that recession.Jim:\u00a0And as I read about, or hear pundits talk about, the yield curve and inversion, there are always arguments about whether it\u2019s the 5-year/2-year slope, 10-year/3-month, 10-year/2-year, you know, pick your slope. What have you found?Cam:\u00a0I think we need to go with the original research. In 1986, I looked at two parts of the yield curve, the 5-year note minus the 3-month bill, and the 10-year bond minus the 3-month bill. The crucial thing is to use a very short-term interest rate. Those two yield spreads are highly correlated. I get nervous when I see people talking about the 10-year minus the 2-year. I got all these emails last week about the 5-year minus the 3-year inverting, saying \u201cHappy Yield-Curve Inversion Day!\u201d An investor can data mine to find a piece of the yield curve\u2014maybe it's the 11\u00bd-year minus the 7\u00be-year\u2014that has an inversion. That doesn't mean anything. I think we need to go with the original un-data-mined theory, which is based on a longer-term rate and a 3-month rate, and the inversion importantly needs to last for a quarter. If it's a day, so what? GDP is measured quarterly, so we need to measure this quarterly also.Jim:\u00a0This is very helpful. Thank you. To reiterate and summarize, we should be looking at the long-term rate versus the short-term rate, and understand that the slope should stay inverted for at least a quarter, and that the recession that follows might be down the road multiple quarters, or even a year or more.Cam:\u00a0That's correct.\u00a0Endnote:Harvey, Campbell. 1988.\u00a0\u201cThe Real Term Structure and Consumption Growth.\u201d Available at SSRN."

  "topic": "ETF Has New Take On Housing",
  "parag": "\u200bAlex Pettee is president and head of ETFs for Hoya Capital Real Estate, a Connecticut-based registered investment advisor. The Hoya Capital Housing ETF (HOMZ) is his firm\u2019s first exchange-traded product and breaks new ground when it comes to the exposure that it offers.Unlike existing ETFs that exclusively target real estate investment trusts (REITs) or homebuilders, HOMZ combines the two and holds stocks of companies from outside those areas also. Pettee spoke with ETF.com to explain why this broader approach to investing in housing is superior. He also offered his latest take on the housing market fundamentals.\u00a0\u00a0ETF.com: What makes your ETF different from the housing ETFs already out there?Alex Pettee: There is the Residential REIT ETF, the iShares Residential Real Estate ETF (REZ), and then there are the homebuilder ETFs, the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB) and the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB). For a while now, we\u2019ve been wondering why there isn\u2019t anything that combines these and looks at the housing sector as a single category. I think a big part of it is that a lot of issuers don't want to stray too far from the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) and from the traditional sector lines. It\u2019s taken a smaller issuer like us to take a housing ETF in a direction that\u2019s outside of GICS and the traditional sectors.ETF.com: What percentage of the portfolio is more homebuilders versus the REITs?Pettee: We wanted to create the index as accurately as we possibly could to track total spending on housing at the national level. Our research spent a long time trying to understand how the housing market\u2014from the GDP level\u2014is defined. What we found is that about 30% of housing spending is on rents and implied rents. There's about $1.5 trillion in direct rents and another $1 trillion in owner-implied rents. Then another 30% is in home construction; another 20% is in home improvement and home furnishings; and the final 20% is in real estate technology and services.That last segment is what I would call the next generation of real estate companies. People would definitely consider companies like Zillow, Redfin and CoreLogic core housing-related companies, yet they\u2019re not found in other housing or homebuilding indices.ETF.com: Even though the four groups the ETF invests in are all housing-related, they each have different fundamental drivers?Pettee: Yes, the ETF should be less volatile because it's owning companies that have historically responded differently to interest rates. REITs are obviously very negatively impacted by rising rates. But then you have the mortgage lenders and servicers that have historically benefited from rising rates. You get this equalizing effect by moving outside the traditional sector lines. It could be a less volatile way to play real estate that's not going to get so swung around by interest rates or by a single economic data point like housing starts or home prices.ETF.com: What\u2019s the outlook for the housing market?Pettee: The focus of what we've been talking a lot about for years is this underinvestment in housing. There\u2019s a number of reasons why it's increasingly more difficult to add new supply, including issues with permitting and zoning. The first result is you get rising rents, rising housing costs and rising home values. The longer-term effect is that existing homes are now getting older and older because there aren't enough new homes being created to lower the average age. The average age of an existing single-family home is now about 38 or 39 years old, which is the oldest it's ever been.The core thesis, which is rising housing costs, is captured by the ETF through owning REITs and other companies that are directly benefiting from rising rents. But the ETF also captures the longer-term effects of the underinvestment in housing by investing in the companies poised to benefit from aging houses, such as roofers, cabinetmakers, etc.ETF.com: It certainly sounds like the longer-term outlook for housing is positive. However, more recently, we\u2019ve seen ups and downs. Late last year and early this year, we saw existing home sales tumble. But now it seems interest rates are coming back down and sales are picking up a little. What's outlook on the housing market for the next year or two?Pettee: It certainly seems like the market has been more mortgage rate sensitive than it was in the prerecession period. In our view, what we saw in 2018 is very similar to what we saw in 2014, when, after the taper tantrum, the 30-year rate rose about 1%, and new and existing home sales slowed anywhere from 10-15% year-over-year growth to almost zero growth. Then as rates pulled back, sales growth reaccelerated back to 15% in 2015. We could see something similar this year.\u200bEmail Sumit Roy at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or follow him on Twitter\u00a0sumitroy2"

  "topic": "Bond ETFs Rallying After Fed Pivot",
  "parag": "Fixed-income ETFs are in rally mode after a dovish Fed outlook and feeble European economic data pushed bond prices sharply higher and interest rates sharply lower. Yields across the curve have tumbled, including the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, which hit a 15-month low of 2.38% on Monday.\u00a0US 10-Year Treasury Yield\u00a0The Federal Reserve surprised markets last week when it released forecasts that suggested no rate hikes were coming this year, down from a projection of two hikes as recently as December. The Fed funds rate, which hovers between 2.25% and 2.5%, is not expected to increase due to slower economic growth and increasing overseas risks, said the central bank.Two days later, those risks were confirmed when IHS Markit reported that its German manufacturing PMI tumbled to 44.7 in March, signaling contraction and the weakest pace of manufacturing growth since 2012.Room For Rates To Fall?The struggles of Europe\u2019s largest economy only added to the list of concerns that bond traders are closely scrutinizing. China\u2019s rapidly slowing economy and even a decelerating U.S. economy are top of mind as well.Taken together, it certainly seems like the world is going through something of a global synchronized slowdown, much like there was a global synchronized expansion in 2017. That could be fuel for bond bulls to run prices even higher (and interest rates lower).On the other hand, barring an even steeper deceleration in U.S. growth, Treasury yields could be limited in how much further they can fall given the current Fed funds rate. True, the 10-year yield has dropped below the top end of the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate\u2014but if economic growth comes in close to the Fed\u2019s forecast of 2.1% for 2019, it\u2019s hard to imagine a deeper inversion is in the cards.Treasury ETF Options Regardless of the interest rate trajectory for the rest of the year, investors have many ETF options with which to capitalize on the trend. In the case yields continue lower, high-duration funds will likely do the best.These interest-rate-sensitive ETFs include the popular iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and the lesser-known PIMCO 25+ Year Zero Coupon US Treasury Index ETF (ZROZ), up 3.3% and 4.5%, respectively, so far this year.Alternatively, if rates don\u2019t fall further and they end up staying where they are or even rising, investors may be better off in shorter-duration ETFs. These products won\u2019t decline nearly as much if interest rates reverse course and they still offer relatively attractive yields.Indeed, with the yield curve as flat as it\u2019s been this cycle, short-term bond ETFs are yielding nearly as much as some of their longer-term counterparts.For example, the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV), which holds Treasuries with maturities of less than one year, has a 30-day SEC yield of 2.34% compared with an equivalent yield of 2.42% for the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEF).By comparison, TLT, which owns Treasuries with maturities of more than 20 years, is yielding 2.79%. For the best of both worlds, another option is the iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF (GOVT). It has a portfolio covering nearly the entire Treasury universe, from the 1- to 30-year maturity range. GOVT\u2019s 30-day SEC yield currently stands at 2.39%.Outside Of Treasuries Of course, the bond options aren\u2019t just limited to Treasuries. Corporate bonds and international bonds have also rallied notably in recent weeks.The iShares iBoxx USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) has surged 6% year-to-date and sports a yield of 3.83%.The Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX), which has heavy exposure to Japan and Europe, where rates are at ultra-low levels, rallied 2.9% so far this year. Its dollar-hedged portfolio has a 30-day SEC yield of 0.81%.\u200bEmail Sumit Roy at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or follow him on Twitter\u00a0sumitroy2"

  "topic": "How Insurance Cos. Use ETFs ",
  "parag": "When it comes to institutional investors embracing ETFs, the good news is that insurance companies are using more ETFs in general accounts than they ever have before, and most are looking to increase that allocation in years ahead.The bad news is that almost 40% of insurers have yet to jump into\u2014or return to\u2014ETFs. A recent Greenwich Associates and State Street Global Advisors survey of 52 insurance companies commanding about $1.9 trillion in combined assets found that 20% of insurers have evaluated or used ETFs at some point in the past, but no longer do. Another 20% of them have never even considered the exchange-traded wrapper.What still holds back ETF adoption among many institutions is, first, regulation and internal mandates that keep allocations tied to \u201cpreferred\u201d vehicles, the survey found. Secondly, many insurers aren\u2019t convinced ETFs are a viable source of alpha, so they still steer clear of them.Regulation Key For AdoptionBut this is an evolving landscape for ETFs. By and large, insurers who have yet to embrace the vehicle say they are likely to revisit that stance as the regulatory environment changes over time, according to the survey.ETF-friendly regulation is key to adoption among institutions. And that\u2019s happening. Changes in regulation have recently buoyed ETF usage among insurance companies; specifically, usage of fixed-income ETFs.To insurance companies, the accounting treatment of fixed-income ETFs made it difficult for adoption because statement filings were designed for individual bonds, not portfolios of bonds.\u201cAs insurance companies began adopting ETFs more and more, they were finding some inconsistencies as to how fixed-income ETFs were being accounted for on the statutory statement filings,\u201d said State Street\u2019s Insurance ETF specialist Chad Nettleship.\u201cThere was a lack of clarity,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen I'm filling out my statutory statement filings, the cookie-cutter boxes are focused on individual fixed-income securities\u2014the pricing of the bonds, based off par as opposed to share price; how am I accounting for these? Am I using fair value? Am I using what they were at cost?\u201d\u2018Game Changer\u2019But in 2017 the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)\u2014insurance\u2019s main regulatory body\u2014changed the accounting treatment of fixed-income ETFs, allowing insurance companies to use the \u201cbond-like treatment of \u2018systematic value\u2019 to fixed-income ETFs,\u201d the survey said.That means insurers can now use a modified amortized cost method of accounting for fixed-income ETFs that\u2019s based on\u00a0projected cash flows for the fund itself, according to Nettleship. They can now choose to use systematic value over fair value for fixed-income ETFs.\u201cThe ruling allowed for optionality for the insurance companies,\u201d Nettleship said. \u201cThe key part is that it allows an insurance company to establish an initial book value for that ETF position, and a book yield.\u201dThe change in regulation is opening the door for much more widespread adoption of fixed-income ETFs among insurance companies. Two-thirds of those surveyed point to NAIC\u2019s designation and ruling as key to ETF investment, and many have already begun adopting the systematic-value treatment for fixed-income ETFs, calling it a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the space.How Insurers Are Using ETFsFixed income, however, isn\u2019t the only asset class insurance companies are increasingly accessing through ETFs. Many institutions like equity ETFs for long-term or tactical allocations.\u201cAs might be expected, based on the duration of their liabilities and composition of their portfolios, life [insurance] companies are bigger users of fixed-income ETFs (83%) while [property & casualty] companies are more likely to use equity ETFs (92%),\u201d the survey said.\u00a0For a larger view, please click on the image above.\u00a0\u201cETFs have been used by insurance companies for quite some time, mostly on the surplus side of the portfolios for broad U.S. equity exposure\u2014the S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has long been the most widely held ETF among insurance companies,\u201d Nettleship said.\u201cWe were seeing a complete opposite view of the traditional insurance portfolio, where the vast majority of the allocations are geared toward fixed income securities,\u201d he said. \u201cBut through the ETF lens, the vast majority of the allocations to ETFs were on the equity side.\u201d\u201cAs the NAIC designations came out for fixed-income ETFs, what we're starting to see now is a reversal of that,\u201d Nettleship added. \u201cFixed-income ETF growth is starting to pop more so than the equity side.\u201dWhere Growth Will Come FromYear-over-year from 2016 to 2017, fixed-income ETF assets grew 69% among institutions, he says. And still, according to the survey, only about one-third of insurers currently use ETFs to diversify fixed-income exposure.That number is expected to near 50% within three years. What\u2019s more, 42% of those surveyed say they may turn to ETFs for tactical purposes in years ahead, targeting segments such as high yield or emerging market debt with fixed-income ETFs.\u201cGrowth, though, will not be limited to fixed-income portfolios,\u201d the survey said.While most insurance companies currently using ETFs say they are likely to increase usage in the next three years, about 80% of the holdouts in this industry say they are probably going to reconsider ETFs in the near future, data show.\u201cETFs are becoming mainstream components of insurance company general account portfolios,\u201d the survey said. \u201cLike pension funds and other institutional investors, insurance companies have discovered the liquidity, transparency and efficiency ETFs offer for tactical and strategic investing.\u201d\u00a0For a larger view, please click on the image above.\u00a0Contact Cinthia Murphy at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "parag": "Boeing (BA) has been in the news lately, for all the wrong reasons. After two high-profile crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia led to a grounding of all new Boeing 737 planes and heightened scrutiny over the aircrafts' safety features, Boeing's stock has tanked 11% since mid-March.That has led some investors to re-evaluate their holdings in the company, as well as funds that own the stock (read: \"Boeing's Lesson About The Dow\").Intriguingly, the ETF with the highest percentage allocation to Boeing isn't the $70 million US Global Jets ETF (JETS), as you might think. (JETS, which tracks the global airline industry, only allocates a 2.6% weight to Boeing.)Instead, it's the $5 billion iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), which, according to BlackRock data, allocates 20.7% of its portfolio, or $1 billion, to Boeing.(Use our\u00a0stock finder\u00a0tool\u00a0to find an ETF\u2019s allocation to a certain stock.)As such, Boeing's stock price tends to be a significant driver of ITA's returns. According to the asset correlations tool at Portfolio Visualizer, the prices of these two securities have a correlation of 0.77 over the past year, meaning that whichever direction one goes, the other tends to go 77% of the time. And over the past month, ITA has fallen 4.3%:\u00a0\u200bSource: StockCharts.com; data range 3/20/18\u00a0-\u00a03/20/2019\u00a0Under ITA's HoodITA tracks the U.S. manufacturers, assemblers and distributors of airplane and defense equipment\u2014of which Boeing is a significant player.Other stocks in ITA's portfolio include United Technologies (UTX) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), which comprise 17.2% and 6.1% of the ETF's portfolio, respectively.Though these weights are high, the actual market dominance of these three firms is even higher. But ITA's underlying benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index, caps its exposure to any one security at 22.5%. This gives ITA a size tilt toward small and midcap firms. \u00a0Despite its lackluster one-month return, ITA is still performing well over the year. Since Jan. 1, the fund is up 15.3%, compared with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which is only up 13.5% over the same period.XAR OutperformsITA is the biggest defense ETF, but it isn't the cheapest. The fund costs 0.43%, which is 0.08% more than its nearest competitor, the $1.3 billion SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR).Also, unlike the market cap-weighted ITA, XAR uses a tiered weighting scheme, splitting its portfolio into a 40/40/20 mix of large-caps, midcaps and small-caps, which are then equally weighted within the tiers. As a result, Boeing only comprises 3.4% of XAR, while United Technologies comprises 3.9% and Lockheed Martin comprises 3.8%.The alternative weighting scheme (and cheaper cost) seems to be giving XAR a performance edge. Over the past 12 months, XAR is up 7.0%, whereas ITA has risen only 1.6%.Year-to-date, XAR is up 16.8%.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "The Wild West Of ETF Performance",
  "parag": "[Editor\u2019s Note: The following originally appeared on FactSet.com. Elisabeth Kashner is director of ETF research and analytics for FactSet.]\u00a0When there\u2019s no good answer to a basic question, it\u2019s time to ask for a better one.Investors and ETF asset managers want to know how an ETF performed over the past week, month or year. Often, they want to compare ETF performance, to see how their fund did versus its competition. They might also want to measure tracking difference or end-of-day premium/discount levels.Often, all they get is frustrated. Shockingly, it is nearly impossible to make a fair, apples-to-apples comparison within an ETF market segment.The most reliable metric of a fund\u2019s valuation, the end-of-day net asset value, or NAV, can be calculated in two ways. Each tells a valid story, one which stands on its own. But too often they cannot stand together. The time is ripe to standardize NAV calculation requirements.Pick Your PoisonNAVs\u00a0can be designed to minimize calculated tracking difference or premium/discount. Often, it\u2019s not possible to do both, because ETF asset managers must choose an NAV accounting method for setting each portfolio security\u2019s closing price, along with a time of day for foreign currency conversions.For two-thirds of all U.S. ETFs, the choice is a bitter one. Aligning strike times with capital market closings minimizes premiums/discounts, but can wreak havoc with tracking difference. Synchronizing with benchmark valuation tightens tracking difference but blows out premium/discount results.The result: Major asset classes, including international equity, all fixed income, commodities and currencies have overstated tracking error or trading costs. U.S. equity portfolios are the only major group spared the trade-off.\u00a0Benchmark StyleThe \u201cbenchmark\u201d style minimizes tracking error, at the expense of premium/discount.\u00a0The \u201cno lawsuits\u201d style, born in response to the mutual fund timing scandal, minimizes the levels of premium/discount because all currency valuations happen at 4 p.m. ET. This comes at the cost of higher tracking error, as custodian-style funds are not aligned with index valuation practices.This trade-off is evident in equity funds holding\u00a0foreign stocks such as the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG), which follows benchmark conventions, and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO), which follows \"no lawsuits\" conventions, lowering (but not eliminating) premium/discount at the expense of tracking error.\u00a0The charts below contrast each fund\u2019s daily premium/discount with its daily tracking error. The premium/discount is shown in blue and the tracking error in orange.\u00a0Blue premium/discount dominates IEMG\u2019s chart, to the point where orange tracking error is nearly invisible.\u00a0\u00a0(For a larger view, click on the image above)\u00a0Both colors are visible in VWO\u2019s chart, but orange tracking error stands out, while blue premium/discount is more muted.\u00a0\u00a0(For a larger view, click on the image above)\u00a0Naming The Apples & OrangesThe different NAV calculation styles make a direct comparison of fund returns between major issuers impossible. Return differences might be explained by FX conversion times rather than by economic exposure.\u00a0Most asset managers do not disclose which of the methods they have chosen, leaving investors to assume the worst for fund efficiency or tradability. Worse, the lack of disclosure makes apples-to-apples performance comparisons impossible.This table lays out the FX conversion times for the top ETF issuers in the U.S. Funds domiciled in Canada and Europe are more likely to use the market close timing over WM Reuters.\u00a0\u00a0*Invesco mostly follows WM Reuters rules, but switches to fund custodian rules when exchange rate changes exceed a threshold.\u00a0The apples-to-oranges NAVs make comparisons difficult. Sometimes, it\u2019s not even possible to compare two ETFs that track the same underlying index.For example, the Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE) and the Invesco PureBeta FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (PBEE) both track the FTSE Emerging Markets Index. Their portfolios are quite similar. Schwab\u2019s SCHE calculates NAVs benchmark-style, while Invesco\u2019s PBEE switches back and forth between benchmark and \"no lawsuits\" styles. It\u2019s easy to pick out the days when PBEE uses no-lawsuits-style rules.\u00a0(For a larger view, click on the image above)\u00a0If Not NAV, Then What?If NAV doesn't work, what does? It is tempting to look to a fund's closing market price as a normalized performance indicator. After all, market forces should value the two portfolios equally, and ETFs trade right up through the closing bell.That\u2019s true in theory, but not always in practice. Some ETFs trade thinly, or not at all. PBEE doesn\u2019t trade at all most days, with an average daily share volume of 23 (23, not 23,000!). PBEE\u2019s pricing is often stale, and not reflective of its current market value. Below is a comparison chart based on normalized closing prices.\u00a0(For a larger view, click on the image above)\u00a0It turns out that price can be a fraught metric, sometimes more extremely than NAV.Another possible solution would be to reference each fund\u2019s underlying index, and then adjust performance based on median tracking difference. But this approach comes with a price tag. Most indexes require a paid license as a prerequisite for data access. Moreover, index calculation methodologies can differ, especially their\u00a0treatments of foreign withholding taxes.With NAVs following at least two sets of rules, closing prices are useful only for the most liquid funds. In addition, index values locked behind a paywall and that are inconsistent across the industry leave ETF holders who want a definitive portfolio value with imperfect options.\u00a0ETF Rule Amendment?The ETF industry can fix this problem and improve the public\u2019s understanding of their funds\u2019 performance. The solution: Publish two NAV series, one synchronized with the underlying index methodology, the other with the securities markets. The first could be used to evaluate tracking difference, the second for calculating end-of-day premium/discount.Either would be suitable for performance reporting and comparisons. As the SEC puts its finishing touches on the \u201cETF Rule,\u201d perhaps it should consider adding a new requirement: standardized NAVs, in two flavors.At the time of writing, the author held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Total investment dollars into the asset class have risen 9.4%, up to $74.1 billion (read: \"Whopping $37B Flows Into ETFs\").However, only two ETFs accounted for 75% of these flows: the Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX) and the iShares JP Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB). BNDX brought in $2.9 billion of new net money year-to-date, while EMB brought in $2.2 billion.\u00a0Source: ETF.com; date range: 1/1/2019 \u2013 3/18/2019\u00a0Emerging Market Debt HotTo some extent, those flows aren't too surprising, as EMB and BNDX are also the two largest international fixed-income ETFs, at $17.1 billion and $16.0 billion in AUM, respectively.However, in the case of EMB, strong performance is also likely driving some of the flows. Emerging market debt has rallied on the back of a falling U.S. dollar. When the greenback falls, global debt denominated in local currency tends to benefit.Of all the international bond ETFs, EMB is the third-best-performing, rising 6.6% over a three-month period. That's second only to the $184 million First Trust SSI Strategic Convertible Securities ETF (FCVT) and the $3.5 billion Invesco Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt ETF (PCY), which have risen 7.1% and 6.9%, respectively.Lured by these high returns, investors have begun to pivot back to emerging market debt. In fact, four of the top six international bond ETFs with the highest inflows year-to-date have been emerging market funds. The $5.4 billion VanEck Vectors J.P. Morgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF (EMLC) and the $1.2 billion iShares J.P. Morgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF (LEMB) have also seen strong year-to-date inflows: $731 million and $125 million, respectively.BNDX: Broad Liquid ExposureAs for Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX), the particular motivation behind the inflows is less likely a result of the emerging markets rally. The fund allocates only 4% to emerging markets. The bulk of its portfolio is in Europe (57%) and the Pacific (26%), mainly Japan and Korea.However, with an expense ratio of 0.09%, BNDX is tied for the cheapest international bond ETF, making it a natural choice for a cost-conscious investor looking to diversify their fixed-income allocation to overseas debt.BNDX's main competitor, the $1.2 billion iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF (IAGG), also costs 0.09%. But whereas BNDX brought in $2.9 billion year-to-date, IAGG has only netted $167 million.That could be due to BNDX's massive liquidity, which gives it a trading boost. BNDX trades $148 million worth of average volume daily, compared with IAGG's $9 million in volume. BNDX also has a lower average spread of 0.02%, compared with IAGG's 0.03%.But the flows may also have something to do with IAGG's heavily optimized portfolio. Though the two ETFs track similar indexes, IAGG holds about 2,500 names, compared with BNDX's 5,400. That means a less diverse portfolio, and one that can sometimes result in higher tracking differences to its index, especially in times of market stress.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "15 Most Actively Traded ETFs",
  "parag": "If there\u2019s one thing traders love, it\u2019s volatility. Large price swings create opportunities for nimble traders to time the market by buying low and selling high.Take the precipitous drop in the U.S. stock market during the second half of 2018\u2014down 20% at one point. And then the equally impressive rebound so far in 2019\u2014up 13% year-to-date. Those are the types of moves that traders dream of.It\u2019s not a surprise then that as the market has swung around excitedly in the past several months, traders have swung into action.The increased trading activity is reflected in the market\u2019s volume levels. Volume\u2014a measure of how many shares trade hands on a given day\u2014is averaging 7.2 billion shares per day across the major U.S. exchanges, over the past year. That compares with an average of 6.7 billion shares in the year prior.Much of that volume is showing up in ETFs. The most actively traded securities on U.S. exchanges are often ETFs, with tens of millions of shares exchanging hands each day in some popular names.Trader FavoritesTake the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). It traded an average of 74.9 million shares per day on average during the last 30 days. For comparison, General Electric\u2014the most actively traded stock within the S&P 500\u2014traded an average of 107 million shares in that same time frame.SPY isn\u2019t the only ETF traders love. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF), the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) are a few heavyweights that routinely trade more than 20 million shares per day.In many cases, these heavily traded funds aren\u2019t the cheapest ETFs in their category, nor do they have the most assets under management. Instead, they\u2019re often old, established funds with liquid options markets underlying them\u2014characteristics that appeal to traders.Indeed, there are several cases where ETFs that are small in terms of assets have huge amounts of volume. For instance, the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXXB) only has $620 million in AUM, but it trades a whopping 23 million shares per day, making it the tenth-most-traded ETF on the market.\u00a0Top 15 Volume Leaders\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) and the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ) only have a few billion dollars in assets between them, but they each trade more than 17 million shares per day.Those aren\u2019t the only ones punching above their weight. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI), the United States Oil Fund LP (USO) and the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) all have outsized volumes compared with assets.Dollar VolumeOf course, simply measuring the volume of shares that trade hands for a particular ETF doesn't tell the whole story. All else equal, cheaper-priced funds tend to have more shares traded because investors can simply buy more for a given amount of money.Dollar volume\u2014which measures the number of shares traded multiplied by the share price\u2014gives a more complete view of how much money is exchanging hands in a security.At the top of the list, the picture doesn\u2019t change with this new measure. SPY is still top dog, with $20.8 billion worth of shares trading hands each day. QQQ, IWM, EEM are also close to the top, with more than $3 billion worth of shares traded daily.Impressively, FXI also makes the cut for this list, with almost $1.3 billion worth of shares trading each day despite only having $6.3 billion in assets.The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), with dollar volumes of more than $1 billion each, are also punching far above their weight, thanks to strong popularity with traders.\u00a0Top 15 Dollar-Volume Leaders\u00a0\u200bEmail Sumit Roy at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or follow him on Twitter\u00a0sumitroy2"

  "parag": "Flows into multifactor U.S. equity ETFs have gone gangbusters in 2019. Year-to-date, four of the top five largest multifactor U.S. stock ETFs have seen inflows of roughly $100 million or more; altogether, these five funds have brought in $1.8 billion in new assets:\u00a0*This one-day inflow into SPHD represents the first half of a \"heartbeat flow\" trade that was canceled\u00a0two days later. To learn more about these trades, read \"The Heartbeat Of ETF Tax Efficiency.\"Source: ETF.com;\u00a0data range: 1/1/2019 -3/18/2019\n\u00a0\u00a0In January, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (GSLC) saw a week where $194 million entered the fund; the largest one-day inflow was $98 million.Then in February, the Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor ETF (OMFL) saw an influx of $559 million, far and away the fund's largest inflow ever.On Monday, March 11, the Franklin LibertyQ U.S. Equity ETF (FLQL) saw a massive one-day influx of $451 million that nearly doubled the size of the fund.Meanwhile, the Invesco S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (SPHD) hasn't see significant one-day net inflows, but rather a consistent influx of cash all year, a snowball effect that has totaled $250 million year-to-date.Flows Coming From Inside The House?We can't yet know for sure precisely who has invested all this money into multifactor U.S. stock funds. We won't know that until this quarter's 13F statements are published, revealing what ETFs are owned by which asset managers worth $100 million or more (read: \"Who's Buying What ETF?\").Even then, 13F filings only report ownership data as of a certain date in time, not what money managers currently own, right this second. They're also self-reported, and can contain misleading data (more on that in a second).Still, at least in the case of FLQL, we can make an educated guess, based on the size of the inflows and prior filings.As of Dec. 31, ownership in FLQL was dominated by Franklin itself, which reported itself as owning $421 million of the fund (source). At the time, however, FLQL had only $384 million in assets under management, meaning there was likely some double-counting baked into this figure (e.g., Franklin held the fund on behalf of its own mutual funds or annuity products).\u00a0Nothing nefarious is going on here, by the way; this sort of double-counting is commonplace whenever you're dealing with funds that hold ETFs.\u00a0 \u00a0The point is that Franklin owned most of FLQL as of year-end 2018. So when massive, double-the-fund-assets-in-one-go-type flows start showing up in 2019, it stands to reason Franklin is the one behind those flows as well.Eating Their Own LunchIf our hypothesis proves true, it would be just one more example of the bring-your-own-assets approach toward growing ETFs that we've seen recently, as institutions increasingly eat their own ETF lunch.From J.P. Morgan's billion-dollar flows into its own BetaBuilder funds, to John Hancock's flows into its own multifactor emerging fund last November, big money managers are pouring money into their own branded products.Far from a new trend, however, this represents a return to the industry's earliest days. ETFs began life as a vehicle designed for institutions, only to later find success with retail investors. In recent months, we've seen the pendulum of inflows swing back hard toward institutional use.Only time\u2014and our fund flows tool\u2014will tell if retail investors once again follow institutions, whether into multifactor ETFs or elsewhere.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "How To Pick A Muni Bond ETF",
  "parag": "Muni bonds\u2014as measured by the ICE BofAML Municipal Index\u2014have already delivered higher returns this year than they did in the entire 2018 calendar year. It\u2019s a pocket of the fixed-income market that has been benefiting from strong demand and limited supply, and many are calling for more growth ahead.That demand could remain supported by new rules impacting state and local tax (SALT) deductions. Until last tax season, taxpayers could deduct local and state taxes\u2014things like income and property taxes\u2014in their federal income tax returns without limits. But new legislation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act now caps SALT deductions to $10,000.This limitation may have you looking for other ways to manage your tax bill\u2014and munis are well-known for delivering tax-exempt interest. It\u2019s a fixed-income darling for tax-sensitive investors.Broad Set Of ChoicesThere are 45 muni bond ETFs available today. To many, a minimum-asset threshold is one of the first metrics considered when choosing an ETF. In the muni space, there are at least eight ETFs that boast more than $1 billion each in total assets.Some of the biggest funds include the iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB), which has $11.8 billion in assets under management; the Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond ETF (VTEB), with $4.3 billion; the SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Short Term Municipal Bond ETF (SHM), with $3.6 billion; the SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond ETF (TFI), with $2.8 billion; and the VanEck Vectors High-Yield Municipal Index ETF (HYD), with $2.5 billion. Their year-to-date performance is below:\u00a0Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\u00a0These are all big, popular, liquid choices for investors. They are all, also, passively managed. However, there are those who think the constraints of an index leave too much opportunity on the table.Consider Maria Rahni, senior associate for product management at New York Life Investments, who argues that the inefficient and illiquid nature of the muni space is a prime playground for active managers and alpha seekers.\u201cWhen should investors consider actively managed ETFs? Typically, inefficient markets lend themselves well to active management\u2014one such market is U.S. municipal bonds,\u201d Rahni said in a recent blog. \u201cActively managed municipal bond ETFs combine the best features of ETFs and mutual funds into one solution: They offer investors access to professional management of an inefficient asset class within a cost-effective, liquid investment vehicle.\u201dActive Muni ProductsIf you agree with Rahni, your list of biggest ETFs to choose from looks a little different. They\u2019d include funds such as the actively managed First Trust Managed Municipal ETF (FMB), with $609 million in assets; the PIMCO Intermediate Municipal Bond Active ETF (MUNI), with $276 million; and the iShares Short Maturity Municipal Bond ETF (MEAR), with $174 million. Their year-to-date performance is below:\u00a0Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\u00a0Stacking Up The LeadersIf you were to compare the broad, biggest passive MUB to the broad, biggest active FMB, allocation differences are stark.The comparison isn\u2019t really apples to apples given that MUB is constrained by its investment-grade index and FMB is free to roam\u2014and can even own some high-yield exposure. Still, both ETFs have duration of about 5.6-5.9 years, according to ETF.com data. \u00a0Notable here is that MUB allocates heavily to California- and New York-issued debt, while FMB holds cash as its second-largest holding, and New York is nowhere in its top 10 allocations\u2014differences that lead to different results.FMB Portfolio BreakdownMUB Portfolio Breakdown\u00a0So far this year, FMB has outperformed MUB, as the chart below shows:\u00a0MUB Vs. FMB YTD PerformanceChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\u00a0Active Vs. Passive Individual ChoiceBut when it comes to picking passive or active management in an ETF wrapper, there\u2019s no right or wrong mousetrap. As CreditSights municipal strategist Patrick Luby puts it, it all boils down to individual investor goals.When does it make sense to choose a passive approach to munis versus an active muni ETF? Luby offers the following guidelines: \u00a0\u201cFor investors with existing portfolios of individual bonds who want to have access to the exchange-traded liquidity that comes with ETFs, it may be difficult to build an investment policy around the bond portfolio plus an active strategy. It can be done, but requires comfort with both the specifics of building a fixed income portfolio as well as the mechanics of the ETF marketplace.\u201cOn the other hand, for investors who are in the wealth-accumulation phase, an actively managed fixed income ETF could be a really great solution because it delegates to the portfolio manager the ability to react to prevailing market conditions in a way that cannot be done when constrained by an index. As a \u2018core\u2019 position for the investor accumulating assets, ETFs can be a great solution, and actively managed ETFs would be especially appropriate to consider in that situation.\u201dOpting for an active strategy in the muni market, he adds, shouldn\u2019t be driven by the notion that the muni market is inefficient, but by a conviction that your chosen professional manager may be able to better navigate changes and opportunities in the market.Do Your HomeworkTo that end, manager due diligence is crucial to your process of finding the right ETF, \u201cbecause it is that experience that the ETF investor is looking to guide their money through economic and interest rate cycles,\u201d Luby said.That\u2019s especially true because you\u2019ll also be paying a lot more for the access. FMB\u2019s active approach comes with a 0.50% expense ratio versus MUB\u2019s 0.07% price tag. You are paying 7x the passive choice\u2019s cost for that chance to capture outperformance. It goes without saying that having conviction in your manager is really important.For a complete list of muni ETFs, check out our muni ETF channel.Contact Cinthia Murphy at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "ETF Of The Week: The Weirdest Fund Turns 20",
  "parag": "How do you explain a fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)?The sixth-largest ETF by assets, and the second-most-actively traded, QQQ (sometimes called \"the Q\u2019s\") defies easy explanation. Is it a tech market proxy? A large-cap growth fund? A thematic, \"innovation\" ETF?It's none of these, says FactSet's Director of Research Elisabeth Kashner: \"It's a Rorschach test.\"QQQ is many things to many different people, she explains. With over $67 billion in assets under management, QQQ is one of the largest ETFs in existence; in fact, the fund is so popular, it accounts for $1 of every $50 invested in U.S. ETFs. But pinning down exactly what investors use QQQ for is no easy task.\"The Q\u2019s are such a mystery to me that I don't quite know what investors think they're getting when they put money into the fund,\" Kashner added.Tech Fund That Wasn'tQQQ's benchmark is the Nasdaq-100 Index, which tracks the top 100 stocks by market cap listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, excluding financials.Once upon a time, that meant tech stocks: In 2000, one year after QQQ launched, a full 78% of the index (and QQQ) was allocated to the tech sector (right during the worst of the dot-com crash). Indeed, for years afterward, QQQ was dominated by its significant allocation to Microsoft (MSFT) and, later, to Apple (AAPL).Today however, tech stocks comprise only 60% of QQQ. Most of that is in the handful of \"FAANG\" stocks: Facebook (FB) (5%), Amazon (AMZA) (9%), Apple (10%), Netflix (NFLX) (2%), Alphabet (GOOGL) (10%) and Microsoft (10%). Meanwhile, another 21% of QQQ is in consumer cyclical stocks, like Pepsi (PEP) and Costco (COST), while another 9% is in health care stocks.Yet traders still use QQQ as a proxy for the tech industry, and when tech swings, so too do flows in and out of QQQ. For example, since tech stocks began to droop back in October, QQQ has seen net outflows of $2.6 billion.For his part, John Frank, QQQ's equity product strategist for Invesco, resists the description of QQQ as a tech fund.\"I don't think QQQ is necessarily about technology, but about technology-enabled companies. It's about innovation,\" he said. \"These are today's companies which are changing the economy for the better and growing well. It's almost sector-agnostic.\"Good Growth, Better Long-Term PerformanceFrank argues that QQQ is better understood as a large-cap growth fund, citing the above-average R&D budgets and investment by Nasdaq-100 companies, as compared to S&P 500 companies.The idea of QQQ as a large-cap growth ETF makes some sense. For example, the fund's price-to-earnings ratio is roughly 24, placing it solidly at market average, while its price-to-book ratio is relatively high at 5.6.Yet comparable\u2014or better\u2014metrics are available from other dedicated large-cap growth funds, such as the $42 billion iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF), which has a P/E ratio of 25 and a P/B ratio of 7.0.However, what QQQ offers is fairly strong risk-adjusted returns, especially over the long term. Over the past 10 years, the fund has returned 21%, compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)'s 16% and IWF's 18%.\u00a0Source: StockCharts.com; data range 3/14/16 -\u00a03/14/19\u2018Marketing Triumph\u2019The Nasdaq-100 Index on which QQQ is based is itself a strange beast, says Kashner, who explains that the index was first developed in 1985 as a way to promote the then-up-and-coming Nasdaq exchange, boosting its liquidity and popularity compared with its competitors, the NYSE and AMEX.\"It's a marketing triumph; there's no question about that,\" she added.As a modified market-cap-weighted benchmark, the Nasdaq-100 blends equal and market-cap weighting through an unusual weighting and rebalancing mechanism.According to QQQ's prospectus, the benchmark limits the weight of individual securities to 24% and the top five stocks' combined weight at 40%. Furthermore, the aggregate of stocks with weights higher than 4.5% is limited to 48%.Unusual Rebalancing SchemeShould these limits be exceeded, a cascading rebalance is triggered.First, if the biggest stock weighting exceeds 24%, at the next quarterly rebalance (or at Nasdaq's discretion), the weight of that stock is brought down to 20%. Meanwhile, if the aggregate of stocks with weights higher than 4.5% exceeds 48%, then all those stocks' weights are reduced at once, until the aggregate hits 40%.That freed-up weighting is then distributed, stock by stock, to holdings below 1%; meaning, if a stock has a weight of 0.99%, it is pushed up to 1%, then the next stock that's at 0.98% gets pushed up to 1%, and so on, until all the excess weight is distributed.On an annual basis (or, again, at Nasdaq's discretion), the index is checked to ensure the top five stocks' collective weight doesn't exceed 40%. If they do, they are together scaled down in weight until the combined weight hits 38.5%. Whatever weight is left over is redistributed to the rest of the securities\u2014until they hit a 4.5% cap, at which point the remaining weight is redistributed to those securities that haven't hit 4.5%.Have you gone cross-eyed yet?\"At the core, it's nonsensical,\" said Dave Nadig, managing director of ETF.com (read: \"The Worst Index In The World\"). \"The rebalancing mechanism leaves you with a tortured mash-up of cap-weighting and equal-weighting, while the universe has no grounding in any core investment thesis. It's almost literally a random collection of stocks.\"Invesco\u2019s Frank acknowledges the quirks of the index, but adds that, \"These are just the index rules that Nasdaq implemented so that the index doesn't get too concentrated.\"Quirks In The UIT StructureIntriguingly, QQQ is a holdover from the early days of ETFs, some\u00a0of which launched under the now-mostly-obsolete unit investment trust (UIT) structure. SPY is another example of a UIT, as is the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA).As a UIT, QQQ possesses a few structural quirks. For example, the fund has a life span: According to the prospectus, QQQ must close by either March 4, 2124 or \"the date 20 years after the death of the last survivor of fifteen persons named in the Trust Agreement, the oldest of whom was born in 1986 and the youngest of whom was born in 1996.\"\"Tying the longevity of your product to the health and well-being of the trustees is, to say the least, unusual\" said Nadig.Secondly, UITs may not reinvest their dividends; instead, the trust must hold them as cash and periodically redistribute them to shareholders. That introduces some cash drag into the fund.Given that QQQ's current distribution yield is just 0.79%, it won't be much cash drag. But it can make a difference over the long haul, especially in rising markets.Through-The-Roof VolumeTraders don't seem overly bothered by QQQ's unusual index or structure, however. QQQ remains the second-most-actively traded ETF in the U.S., behind only SPY. On a daily basis, the Q\u2019s trade an eye-popping $5.2 billion in average volume, with almost 31 million shares trading hands at sub-pennywide spreads.\"Knowing that there is liquidity out there puts people's minds at ease,\" said Frank. \"There are hedge funds and institutions that need to change their beta on a dime. So they'll use QQQ to do that.\"\"QQQ has done an extraordinary job as a trading tool,\u201d noted Kashner. \u201cIt's obviously beloved.\"But the fund still leaves her with a lot of questions.\"I have to wonder,\" she added, \"if we'd never had the Q\u2019s and this fund launched today, would it get this kind of reception?\"Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "Emerging Market ETFs Could Keep Rallying",
  "parag": "After a rough 2018, emerging markets are seeing a comeback this year. The largest emerging market ETFs, like the $63 billion Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) and the $59 billion iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG), have risen 9-11% so far in 2019.Some ETFs tracking individual emerging markets\u2014especially those tracking China\u2014are up much more. The $2 billion Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR) has surged a cool 27% since the start of the year.Helping to explain these moves and predict whether the rally can continue is Geoffrey Dennis, an independent emerging market commentator. ETF.com spoke with Dennis, who previously held a position as head of global emerging markets strategy at UBS, to discuss the outlook for emerging markets broadly, as well as the outlook for specific EM countries such as China, Brazil, Turkey and others.\u00a0ETF.com: There\u2019s been a strong rally in emerging markets so far this year. Do you think it will continue?Geoffrey Dennis: Yes. Certainly, the head winds the asset class faced last year were more dramatic than any of us had really anticipated.The head wind that surprised me the most was the way in which the trade war got ramped up so dramatically. There was really nothing at the beginning of 2018 that gave you any suggestion to the degree of escalation of the trade war, including multiple moves on tariffs by Trump against China and Europe. The Fed moved significantly, and that led to a big move in the dollar. A rising dollar has always been negative for emerging markets. It sucks money out of EM.Those two head winds have since abated. It now looks like we\u2019re at \u201cpeak tariffs.\u201d We\u2019re probably going to get a resolution to the China trade war. The Fed has also backed away from rate hikes; I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see any rate hikes by the Fed this year because the U.S. economy is going to slow down.A quiet Fed that could lower rates at some point later this year, if not in 2020, is going to pull the dollar lower. That\u2019s good for emerging markets.Earnings growth will undoubtedly slow in the emerging markets this year, but emerging market stocks are 20% off their highs from last year. That\u2019s not warranted based on the trajectory of earnings, especially with last year\u2019s head winds turning into tail winds.My guess is you're going to see emerging markets go up 15-20% this year, so you've probably seen half the gains you\u2019re going to see.ETF.com: Chinese stocks have surged this year in anticipation of a resolution to the trade war. ETFs tied to A-shares are up 27% already. With those types of gains, is an end to the trade war already priced in?Dennis: A number of things are pushing mainland Chinese stocks up. No. 1 is the optimism that there will be a resolution to the trade dispute with the U.S. No. 2, the slowdown in China is now well-understood, and probably priced into the markets. We are also seeing responses to that in terms of both fiscal and monetary policy. All of that is very important for investors in the Chinese market.Economic slowdowns generally are not good for any market, especially emerging markets. But once they get priced in, people look ahead to the policy easing and the prospect of the slowdown reversing. It\u2019s important to understand that China is slowing down from hyper-growth rates of 13% per annum not that many years ago, to a steady state of somewhere around 5%. The slowdown will continue until it hits that steady-state growth rate, because this is a welfare country that can't grow anymore at those advanced rates.At some point, we'll get a nice surprise and Chinese growth will move up in the short term, but it's still in that long-term trend slowdown. That said, the stock market may be rallying, because the fears of something more serious than that have begun to subside. We'll see if that's right or wrong.Going forward, Chinese stocks are going to be very much driven by how fast and how much the Chinese economy is slowing. But I think you\u2019ve already seen a good chunk of the gains you're going to see for the year as a whole.ETF.com: There was a lot of euphoria surrounding Brazilian stocks after last year\u2019s elections. What\u2019s your take on the market in Brazil?Dennis: Brazil is going to be driven by the success\u2014or lack of success\u2014of pension reform. I think the easy money has been made in Brazil this year. It's going to be driven by the pace of any sort of economic recovery, which will probably be slow.You're not talking about the honeymoon period for President Bolsonaro being over anytime soon, but what I think is going to drive the success or failure of this from a financial markets point of view, is, can he get this pretty wide-ranging pension reform through the Congress without too much watering down?And if this feels like an old story, it is indeed an old story. We've seen this before with Temer and other presidents. The one difference today than what you've seen in the past is the widespread recognition\u2014not only among the policy elite, but also among the country at large\u2014that pension reform now has to be done. The fiscal situation is sufficiently serious that something has to be done. For a big move in Brazil to happen, you've got to have success in the pension. You've got to have at least 70-80% of this pension reform proposal go through. Because the more they water it down, the more people are just going to say it's basically a dead duck.ETF.com: Any thoughts on the worst-performing emerging market last year, Turkey?\nDennis: Turkey is still a very cheap market, but it\u2019s always been a cheap market. With Turkey, you\u2019re probably taking on a little bit more risk because the policy framework is poor. Although the central bank hasn\u2019t made any mistakes lately, it continues to be fearful of the influence of President Erdogan behind the scenes. And of course, Turkey is very close to what is still a very unstable geopolitical arena that includes Syria and Iraq, etc. The economy looks a little bit better, but the fiscal side remains challenging.

  "topic": "Institutional Money Comes To ESG ETFs",
  "parag": "Over the past two weeks, more than $1 billion in institutional money has poured into socially responsible ETFs, leading many to wonder whether environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing has finally \"hit it big.\"Last week, the Xtrackers MSCI U.S.A. ESG Leaders Equity ETF (USSG) had the biggest launch of any ETF in the past 15 years, debuting with an infusion of $843 million from the Finnish insurer, Ilmarinen (read: \"ESG ETF's Launch Biggest In 15 Years\").Earlier this month, Vanguard's two ESG ETFs also saw significant inflows. On March 1, the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV) took in $100 million, while on March 4, the Vanguard ESG International Stock ETF (VSGX) took in $104 million.In the grand scheme of things, $1 billion in inflows\u2014even in a single month\u2014isn't that much in the ETF industry, where total assets invested now top $3.7 trillion.However, as of the end of last year, ESG ETFs had only $8 billion in total assets under management (AUM)\u2014meaning that $1 billion represents a heck of a hefty infusion of new cash (read: \"The Year In ESG ETFs\").Institutional Interest In LRGE, ESGDYear-to-date, the five ESG ETFs with the largest net inflows are:\u00a0Source: ETF.com; data as of 3/8/19\u00a0In addition to USSG and the Vanguard funds, two other funds have notched significant block trades over the past few months, likely from institutional sources.The ClearBridge Large Cap Growth ESG ETF (LRGE), part of Legg Mason's suite of funds, took in roughly $105 million over the course of a week in mid-February. After a year and a half of anemic trading, LRGE saw several consecutive days of $27 million to $30 million in net flows:\u00a0Source: ETF.com;\u00a0data range: 2/8/18 to 3/8/19\u00a0The iShares ESG MSCI EAFE ETF (ESGD) has exhibited an even more intriguing pattern of flows. Since February 2018, iShares ETFs have seen a regular influx of $20 million to $30 million in new cash on the order of every two or three weeks:\u00a0Source: ETF.com; data range: 3/8/18 to 3/8/19\u00a0These steady inflows have made ESGD now the fourth-largest socially responsible fund, at $652 million in AUM. Before they began, ESGD only had $144 million in assets; it didn't even rank among the top 10 largest ESG ETFs (read: \"Where Are The ESG Flows?\").Institutions Don't Want Thematic ESGNotably, the five ESG ETFs bringing in the most money year-to-date aren't narrow, thematic funds. In fact, some of the higher-profile thematic funds that have launched in recent years actually have lost assets so far in 2019, including the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE), which has lost a net $100 million. Meanwhile, UBS's InsightShares LGBT Employment Equality ETF (PRID) and the InsightShares Patriotic Employers ETF (HONR) have lost over 90% of their assets, dropping $23 million and $24 million, respectively.Instead, the five most successful ESG ETFs all promise to replicate the performance of some broad-based market benchmark, just without any of the sin stocks or other objectionable holdings. That makes these ETFs ideal for replacing some or all of the vanilla ETFs held in a traditional asset allocation strategy, while only realizing a slight bump in overall portfolio cost.For example, USSG costs just 0.10%, whereas the cheapest U.S. large cap ETFs, the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF (SCHX) and the SPDR Portfolio Large Cap ETF (SPLG), cost 0.03%. That's an annual difference of just $7 per every $10,000 invested.Essentially, the ESG ETFs that are gaining assets are the ones that offer market performance that's easy on the conscience, while keeping overall costs extremely low\u2014which is exactly what's needed by institutions seeking to satisfy both fiduciary responsibility and ESG investment mandates.Therefore, as prices on ESG ETFs continue to come down, we'll likely see even more institutional money enter the space\u2014and where institutions go, retail usually follows.History Repeats ItselfThat said, it's worth keeping these big one-day inflows in perspective, because institutional money has flowed into ESG ETFs before\u2014with very little lasting impact.In 2014, the SPDR MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF (LOWC) and the iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF (CRBN) were each seeded with cash from the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, which serves 205,000 current and former UN employees, while CRBN received seed money from the University System of Maryland Foundation. In total, CRBN was seeded with $142 million, while LOWC received $22 million.Then in 2016, SHE launched with a significant amount of seed capital from CalSTRS, to the tune of $250 million (read: \"It's All About ETF Seed Money\") .Finally, last year, the Goldman Sachs JUST U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (JUST) made a big splash when it took in $250 million in inflows in its first day, likely from \u201cbring your own assets\u201d money from Goldman Sachs itself (read: \"'JUST' Takes In $250M Its First Day\").With the exception of CRBN, whose AUM has risen to $413 million, none of these ETFs has pulled in meaningful net inflows since their big debuts. In fact, most have lost assets since their initial influx: SHE is now down to $250 million, down from roughly $330 million this time last year. Meanwhile, JUST is now down to $213 million.Even CRBN, which remains well funded, has lost $112 million in outflows year-to-date.Start Of An Avalanche?So while USSG's massive influx was interesting, it's difficult to draw many conclusions from a single day's\u2014or month's\u2014worth of blockbuster inflows. If the inflows continue, perhaps we can start discussing in earnest whether ESG has finally \"hit it big.\"In our opinion, what's more interesting are the steady, quiet and regular inflows into funds like ESGD. Flows like these are like a snowball rolling downhill: barely noticeable, perhaps, until the snowball becomes an avalanche.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

With $33 billion in assets under management, the fund is by far and away the largest real estate ETF, and one of the largest ETFs, period.As Bloomberg Intelligence's Tom Psarofagis pointed out on Twitter, VNQ saw $1.7 billion in net inflows in February, making it the fund's largest month of inflows ever (read: \"February Sees Big ETF Flows Turn\").\u00a0Source: ETF.com; date range, 2/1- 28, 2019\u00a0Performance Chasing & Safe HavenSome of those flows are undoubtably due to performance chasing. Year-to-date, the ETF is up 12.58%, among the best of any vanilla, broad-based U.S. real estate ETF. Only the JPMorgan BetaBuilders MSCI U.S. REIT ETF (BBRE) has done better, at 12.59% (and VNQ is almost 30 times larger than BBRE).But investors are probably also looking to VNQ as a safety play. Concerns about U.S.-Chinese trade relations and increasingly bleak global economic data have led to a slide in bond yields, particularly U.S. Treasuries. In a low-yield environment, real estate can be a haven in the storm\u2014especially now that the Fed has pumped the brakes on rate hikes.Inside VNQVNQ offers relatively size-agnostic exposure to the U.S. real estate market, with a broad portfolio of 191 REITs and real estate stocks (read: \"ETF Picks For A Retiree\").Intriguingly, the fund's second-largest position (after an 11% allocation to the company's own real estate mutual fund) is a 6% allocation to American Tower Corporation (AMT).American Tower is a cellphone tower company and infrastructure play. As such, it adds stability to the portfolio even when other real estate subsectors are declining.VNQ Vs Other Real Estate ETFsVNQ tilts toward commercial REITs (42%), distinguishing it from the $4 billion iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR) (which used to be the second-largest U.S. real estate ETF until the $5 billion Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH) came along).For its part, IYR has a smaller portfolio than VNQ (116 stocks), with a greater allocation in specialized REITS (40%).Meanwhile, SCHH has a higher allocation to commercial REITs than VNQ (49%), with about half as many names as VNQ (99).SCHH is also the cheapest of the big U.S. real estate ETFs, with an expense ratio of 0.07%. Though that undercuts VNQ's 0.12%, investors don't seem to mind, as VNQ remains the sector's clear heavyweight.On average, VNQ trades $600 million in volume every day, more than four times SCHH's average trading volume. (IYR, however, remains the clear favorite for traders, with an eyepopping $710 million in daily trading volume.)Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]. "

  "topic": "More To Low Vol ETFs Than Volatility",
  "parag": "The iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol U.S.A. ETF (USMV) has attracted $2.6 billion in net creations so far this year, making it one of the top 10 most in-demand ETFs of 2019.In a year when so many investors are concerned about volatility in the U.S. stock market, this is hardly surprising. USMV is a great mousetrap in this segment, boasting $23.5 billion in total assets; trading almost $250 million on average every day at an average spread of only 0.02%; and costing 0.15% in expense ratio, or $15 per $10,000 invested.Additional Factor BetsUSMV, however, makes other factor bets relative to the universe of U.S. large-cap-blend equities and to its main competitor, the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV)\u2014SPLV has seen about $842 million in net inflows year-to-date.These factor bets matter because different portfolio tilts appeal to different investor biases, and ultimately lead to different return streams.Year-to-date, the performance disparity between USMV and SPLV is about 1.5 percentage points, as the chart below shows. (Both fund are underperforming the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) this year.)\u00a0Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\u00a03 Key Differences On the surface, there are key easy-to-spot differences between these two portfolios. First, USMV, which is 2.5 times the size of SPLV in total assets under management\u2014$23.5 billion versus $9.7 billion\u2014costs 40% less. USMV has an expense ratio of 0.15% versus SPLV\u2019s 0.25% fee.USMV is also bigger in terms of portfolio size, comprising 215 stocks compared with SPLV\u2019s 100 holdings, so it\u2019s a broader portfolio.\u00a0But there are three other key differences in the way these two ETFs go about serving up access to a lower-vol ride.1. Sector AllocationUSMV has sector constraints, linked to the fund\u2019s methodology where correlation between stocks is considered to deliver a minimum-volatility portfolio. SPLV, on the other hand, looks for the lowest-vol stocks in its universe. It\u2019s an unconstrained strategy that can make significant sector bets at any rebalance\u2014one that currently bets heavily on utilities and real estate.At a glance, here\u2019s how the two portfolios\u2019 sector slices stack up (and their respective differences in top holdings):\u00a0\u00a0For another way to look at the differences between these sector allocations\u2014how they stack up against each other and the broader equity segment these portfolios navigate\u2014consider the chart below:\u00a0(For a larger view, click on the image above)\u00a0Source: Style Analytics\u00a02. ValueIf you have a value bias in U.S. large-cap equities, USMV is probably a better fit for you than SPLV.According to Style Analytics data, USMV tilts more toward value exposures, measured by aspects such as cash flow yield. The fund also tilts more heavily toward dividend yield than SPLV does, as well as the S&P 500.3. GrowthSPLV tilts more toward growth than USMV, keeping its allocation closer to market neutral, measured here as the S&P 500 index (the \u201czero\u201d line in the chart below).\u00a0(For a larger view, click on the image above)\u00a0Source: Style Analytics\u00a0Making An Informed ChoiceAt the end of the day, USMV and SPLV deliver lower volatility relative to the S&P 500 (which serves as the baseline in the charts above\u2014the \u201czero\u201d) as well as lower volatility than the broader segment of U.S. large cap stocks. They do what they set out to do.But an ETF doesn\u2019t stand in a vacuum. Every portfolio tilt, every factor bet, every holding difference impacts your overall mix in a portfolio and, ultimately, your returns. \u00a0USMV may be one of the most popular ETFs of the year, and it may be the low-vol ETF for you, but it\u2019s certainly not a one-size-fits-all strategy for investors concerned with volatility. A look under the hood is key to inform you on all sorts of things before you opt in.Contact Cinthia Murphy at [email\u00a0protected]"

The fund is also tied for cheapest among all ESG ETFs, matched only by the iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (EAGG).Finnish Insurer Involved Though socially responsible funds have steadily gained assets over the past few years, they remain a small pocket of the ETF landscape. Combined, ESG ETFs hold just $8.4 billion in assets under management, or 0.2% of the total assets invested across all ETFs.Yet the tides may be shifting. USSG's blockbuster launch suggests that ESG ETF investing may be picking up in popularity, especially among institutions, which often have ESG-related investment mandates to satisfy.USSG's massive inflows likely had some connection to Finnish mutual pension insurance company Ilmarinen, who collaborated with DWS Group in USSG's development in order to use the fund in their own strategies.The insurer already uses the MSCI U.S. ESG Leaders index, USSG's index, as a benchmark. MSCI's ESG Leaders methodology scores stocks according to their ESG credentials, then picks high-scoring stocks until the index represents half the market capitalization of the parent index (in this case, the MSCI USA Index).That results in a benchmark of only top-tier ESG companies, which is then adjusted by sector (and country) weights to reflect those in the parent index (watch: \"Inside ETFs: Evolving ESG Opportunity Set\").Full Suite Of Equity ETFsDWS already has three other equity funds in its ESG suite, each charging the lowest or nearly the lowest fees in their respective categories (read: \"The Cheapest ESG ETF Portfolio\").These include:However, none of these funds has yet attracted the assets with which USSG debuted.

  "parag": "January, 2018: That\u2019s when Chinese stocks made their last major peak, topping out at 3,559 on the Shanghai Composite Index. The China-U.S. trade war was about to begin, and so was a precipitous slide in the Chinese stock market.From its peak in January, the Shanghai Composite plunged more than 30% over the next 12 months, settling at a four-year low by the end of 2018.Oh, how fast things can change. A little more than two months into the new year, and China is the hottest market in the world.Trade War End In SightYear-to-date, the Shanghai Composite surged 26%, recovering a big chunk of its losses from last year thanks to growing hopes that the China-U.S. trade war is coming to an end.The U.S. has made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in trade talks with China, President Trump recently said, adding that an agreement could be signed as soon as this month.If a trade deal is struck, that would be a huge win for China\u2019s economy, which was buckling under the weight of U.S. tariffs.More Room To Run?To be sure, the world\u2019s second-largest economy still faces many head winds, such as rising debt levels and unfavorable demographics. The government anticipates GDP growth will slow to 6-6.5% in 2019 from 6.6% last year. But compared with some of the dire scenarios that could have unfolded if the China-U.S. trade war escalated, that is a downright rosy outlook.It\u2019s also good news for Chinese stocks, which could keep rallying even after the sizzling gains already seen so far this year. Analysts ETF.com spoke with suggested that China ETFs could revisit their highs from last year, or move even higher if the stimulus measures announced this week\u2014tax cuts and increased government spending\u2014push growth toward the upper end of the target range.In other words, it may not be too late to buy China ETFs. Here\u2019s a rundown of some of the options available for investors, as well top performers and asset gatherers.\u00a0Top-Performing China ETFs Of The YearNote: Data measures total returns for the year-to-date period through March 5.\u00a0Pick Your ExposureThe top China ETFs by assets offer a diverse range of exposures. The $6.4 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) doesn\u2019t hold mainland China stocks. Instead, it consists of a basket of the 50 largest and most liquid Chinese stocks trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.These so-called H-shares have done well, rising 15.1% year-to-date, but not nearly as well as mainland stocks.In contrast to FXI\u2019s highly concentrated, offshore portfolio, the fourth-largest China ETF, the $1.6 billion Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR), holds a broad basket of China shares trading on the mainland.The A-shares basket has rocketed higher this year, rising 30.7%, double the return for FXI.Other large China ETFs are treading in the middle ground between FXI and ASHR. The $4.4 billion iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) provides broad access to U.S.-listed China stocks, H-shares and some A-shares.Meanwhile, the $1.4 billion SPDR S&P China ETF (GXC) does the same, but minus the A-shares. Both funds are up about 19.5% this year.Niche ETFsBroad China ETFs aren\u2019t the only funds targeting the country that investors are fond of. Some of the hottest products target certain sectors or industries within the country.The $2 billion KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB), the $542 million Invesco China Technology ETF (CQQQ) and the $143 million Global X MSCI China Consumer Discretionary ETF (CHIQ) are examples of these more-niche funds.And for the truly brave investors (or speculators), a whole menu of leveraged versions of the various China ETFs are available. From the Direxion Daily FTSE China Bull 3X Shares (YINN), to the Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2X Shares (CHAU) to the Direxion Daily CSI China Internet Index Bull 2X Shares (CWEB), these products promise to deliver big gains or big losses, depending on which way the Chinese markets go.For a full list of all the available China ETFs, see ETF.com\u2019s China channel.

That's the third-highest inflows of any ETF year-to-date.\u00a0Source: ETF.com;\u00a0data as of Feb. 28, 2019\u00a0Why have mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) been so popular? For starters, MBS ETFs offer significantly higher yields than other fixed-income vehicles. For example, MBB currently offers a yield of 3.73%, compared to an average yield for Treasury ETFs of 2.43% (read: \"Big Yields From Mortgage Backed Security ETFs\").Furthermore, MBSs also exhibit higher risk-adjusted returns than other fixed-income instruments. Year-to-date, MBB has returned 0.78%, whereas the average Treasury ETF has returned 0.39% over the same period.MBB Vs VMBSAs the oldest and largest mortgage-backed security ETF, MBB is nearly twice the size of its nearest competitor, the $8.2 billion Vanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF (VMBS).Both are very similar funds, exhibiting profoundly deep liquidity. However, MBB trades on average $152 million of volume daily, compared with VMBS' $40 million. VMBS also has a slightly higher spread of 0.02%, compared to MBB's 0.01%.The biggest difference seems to be in cost. With an expense ratio of 0.09%, MBB is 2 basis points more expensive than the Vanguard fund, which could make a difference to long-term buy-and-hold investors.Yet MBB's ample liquidity makes it the ideal trading vehicle to express a short-term view, particularly on the impact of interest rates, which appears to be just what investors are doing right now.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]."

Since bottoming out at the end of last year, Chinese stocks have roared back on hopes the year-long trade war could be resolved soon.On Monday alone, the $1.6 billion Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR), which tracks mainland Chinese stocks, surged 6.3%, bringing its year-to-date gains to a hefty 25.8%. The move followed news that President Trump had delayed a scheduled hike in tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S.\n\u00a0ASHR YTD Performance\u00a0The U.S. has made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in trade talks with China, Trump tweeted. Therefore, \u201cI will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1. Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a summit for President Xi and myself, at Mar-a-Lago, to conclude an agreement,\u201d Trump added.On the surface, the president\u2019s optimistic tone makes it seem like a trade deal with China is likely to be clinched by next month. But is that truly the case? And if so, what form will the trade deal take, and what will the lasting impact be on Chinese stocks?Trade Deal LikelyMost analysts tend to agree that some sort of trade deal with China is likely this year, though there\u2019s disagreement on the details.\u201cA trade deal is very likely given that both the U.S. and Chinese economies are weak, and both leaders are under pressure to get a deal done,\u201d opined Jay Pelosky, CIO at TPW Investment Management. He expects a deal to be struck relatively soon, because the impetus for a deal is significant, and \u201ca lot of the heavy lifting has been done.\u201d Gregory Daco, head of U.S. Macroeconomics at Oxford Economics, agrees that a deal is more likely than not. He pegs the odds of a deal in the next month at 60%, and the odds of a deal in the next three months at 75%.\u201cThe deal will involve promises by China to import more goods from the U.S., address intellectual property rights and maintain a stable currency,\u201d Daco explained.Will It Have Teeth?While a deal seems likely, whether or not that agreement eliminates current tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese exports remains to be seen.Daco expects existing tariffs to remain in place. On the other hand, Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors, believes there is a high probability they could be eliminated if important issues related to intellectual property and joint ventures can be solved.Of course, whether those tough issues are adequately resolved is what will be most closely scrutinized to determine who \u201cwon\u201d in the trade war.Pelosky believes both countries can end up winners, since the U.S. is asking China to do what is in its best interest anyway, such as rebalancing its economy more toward consumption.But not everyone is convinced that the deal will have teeth. Hao Zhou, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank, said that China \u201cwill probably agree to buy more stuff from the U.S. and lower the barrier for farm goods imports,\u201d but really meaningful structural change to its economy is unlikely. Additionally, Zhou notes that any pact will be fragile given the unstable U.S.-China relationship.China Stocks To Benefit Regardless of what the final form of any potential U.S.-China trade deal takes, one thing that is fairly certain is that the resolution of this bitter saga will be a net positive for the Chinese economy. Does the same hold true for Chinese stocks\u2014especially since they\u2019ve jumped so much already? KraneShares\u2019 Ahern and TPW Investment\u2019s Pelosky think the rally may just be getting started.\u201cI believe China is on the cusp of a structural bull market as the economy bottoms, companies generate double-digit EPS [earnings per share] growth off a low valuation base and foreign interest grows as both equity and debt become bigger parts of global benchmarks,\u201d Pelosky said. Meanwhile, Ahern says that even though Chinese shares have jumped sharply so far this year, valuations for both Hong Kong and mainland stocks are still low, with price-to-earnings ratios of 11 and 14, respectively.If the economy and earnings accelerate as he imagines, those P/E ratios could decline, keeping Chinese stocks cheap even as they rally.Potential Catalysts That said, after such a sizzling start to the year, a pullback or at least some consolidation in China stocks wouldn\u2019t be surprising.Pelosky says a classic buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news type of action could occur once a trade deal is struck, but he\u2019d use that as an opportunity to accumulate positions in China ETFs, which are still down 10-20% from their highs of last year.Ahern adds that there are two catalysts that could keep any pullback in China shares short-lived: the annual Two Sessions policy meetings in March, where potential further tax cuts and stimulus could be announced; and an increase in China\u2019s weighting in MSCI indices.\u201cMSCI is adding 235 Chinese A-shares, but is adding their market cap incrementally,\u201d Ahern explained. \u201cI believe the inclusion factor will be raised from 2018\u2019s 5% to 15% in 2019. I also believe they will add ChiNext stocks in 2019 and midcaps in 2020.\u201dEmail Sumit Roy at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or follow him on Twitter\u00a0sumitroy2"

  "topic": "Proposed Marijuana ETFs Rooted Differently",
  "parag": "Finding investable companies in the marijuana industry isn't easy. For starters, there's the legalization issue: Cannabis remains classified as a Schedule I substance, making it difficult for U.S.-based marijuana firms\u2014including growers, retailers and R&D firms\u2014to secure listing on U.S. exchanges.Then there's the sector's volatility. Marijuana is a rapidly evolving sector, with the individual players and capitalizations changing significantly from year to year, even month to month. Micro caps, reverse takeovers and pink sheets abound, and the handful of well-capitalized, pure-play cannabis companies that do exist often whipsaw monthly in price.\u00a0Source: StockCharts.com;\u00a0data as of Feb. 25, 2019\u00a0With such a small investable universe, you might expect the portfolios for the three newly proposed marijuana ETFs to be pretty much carbon copies of the sole existing pure-play on the market, the $1 billion ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) (read: \"Competition Heats Up In Marijuana ETFs\"). But you'd be wrong.Each of the three funds proposes a unique mousetrap, ensuring that if and when they come to launch, we wouldn't be looking at a slew of me-too products just trying to recapture MJ's lightning in a bottle.A Peek Under MJ's HoodCurrently, MJ is the only pure-play marijuana ETF on the market, though the $14 million AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT) has 37% of its portfolio in cannabis-related and cannabis-adjacent stocks.As an index-based fund, MJ tracks U.S. and global companies involved in one of four main lines of industry:In addition, MJ implements size and liquidity screens to eliminate stocks with a market cap of less than $200 million and a three-month average daily trading volume lower than $500,000.\u00a0For a larger view, please click on the image above.Source: ETF.com; data as of Feb. 25, 2019\u00a0Pure-Play DilutionThough MJ is often billed as a pure-play, its inclusion of forward-looking tobacco plays and ancillary support industries somewhat dilutes its exposure.Tobacco-related companies represent 22% of MJ's portfolio, while Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) and Turning Point Brands (TPB) represent another 2% each. (Although alcohol companies dabbling in cannabinoid/THC-related products are not specifically called out in MJ's prospectus, they do and have appeared in the fund's portfolio in the past.)That leaves an opportunity for competitors to offer a purer-play investment on the marijuana sector.Furthermore, it's worth noting that, over the past year, MJ has run into issues with its service providers, including its original custodian, U.S. Bank, which was reluctant to custody stocks associated with a federally illegal substance.In September, ETFMG parted ways with U.S. Bank and signed Wedbush Securities, a regional broker-dealer, to act as its custodian instead (read: \"Marijuana ETF Shifts Custody\").Using Derivatives To Access Marijuana StocksStarting last year, a slew of new marijuana ETF proposals were filed. Last November, Innovation Shares filed for its Innovation Shares Cannabis ETF, while in January, AdvisorShares filed for the AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF.Then, earlier this month, Amplify ETFs filed for the Amplify Seymour Alternative Plant Economy ETF (read: \"Competition Heats Up In Marijuana ETFs\").Of the three, perhaps the most different from MJ is AdvisorShares' proposed fund, which would use primarily swaps, futures and other derivatives to gain access to both U.S.- and foreign-listed cannabis equities and cannabis indexes.This means that, for the most part, the marijuana stocks that large U.S. banks are so loath to hold wouldn't technically be part of the fund portfolio; the ETF would hold derivatives of those stocks instead. (The fund may also hold some stocks, though presumably not the ones a custodian bank would object to holding.)While potentially solving the custodial risk issue, banks' use of derivative instruments is widespread and commonplace\u2014using derivatives in place of stocks could introduce myriad other trading and market risks.Active Management Casts Wide NetAs an actively managed fund, AdvisorShares would have wide leeway in what criteria to use in building its portfolio, including third-party analyst ratings and stock selection tools, as well as the firm's own discretion on overlooked and undervalued stocks.The fund managers also reserve the right to participate in initial public offerings, an unusual step that could widen their investment scope and potentially provide an edge.To be eligible for inclusion in the fund, though, constituents would need to derive at least 50% of their net revenue from the legal marijuana and hemp industry; or be registered with the Drug Enforcement Agency specifically to engage in cannabinoid-related medical R&D.At least 25% of the fund's portfolio would be concentrated in pharma, biotech and life sciences firms researching cannabis-based medicines.And, of course, the stock would need to be legal. \"The Fund will only invest in companies that engage in cannabis-related business that is permitted by national and local laws of the relevant jurisdiction,\" said the prospectus.Amplify Enlists Expert Portfolio ManagerAmplify's proposed ETF would also be actively managed. However, rather than relying on in-house expertise, Amplify lists Tim Seymour, CNBC host and marijuana investing expert, as the fund's portfolio manager.Seymour will base portfolio decisions on public regulatory filings, third-party research and other public data, as well as his own evaluations of the companies' financial fundamentals, taking into consideration everything from macroeconomic trends to environmental, social and governance scores.Of the three filings, Amplify's proposal delineates the clearest rules about what kinds of global companies the funds can and cannot invest in, breaking eligible constituents into three categories:Amplify's approach also implements several liquidity screens, including a minimum market cap of $75 million for U.S. stocks and $100 million for foreign stocks, and a three-month average daily trading volume of at least 1 million shares.Some Similarities To MJ Like MJ, the Amplify proposal wouldn't be pure-play, precisely; rather it would take a holistic, cross-disciplinary approach toward the cannabis industry.However, it would forgo exposure to tobacco companies, at least at first.Amplify's prospectus also takes great pains to point out that the companies it invests in will be legal\u2014in fact, using the same language in spots as MJ's prospectus, language which so far has passed muster with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Index-Based ApproachOf the three filings, only the Innovation Shares proposal would be index-based, but that doesn't necessarily mean it would be a vanilla product.Details about the index are slim, and Innovation Shares declined to comment for the article, citing the \"quiet period\" before launch. However, the prospectus lists the Innovation Labs Cannabis Index as its benchmark.No information about the index has yet been published, but it is likely that the index will resemble the other Innovation Labs benchmarks that underpin the $10 million Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF (KOIN) and the $1 million Innovation Shares NextGen Vehicles & Technology ETF (EKAR).Those indexes use an AI-driven selection process to evaluate potential constituents, implementing a proprietary natural language processing algorithm that scours public documents and online databases for information to sort and rank companies.More Limited In Scope The Innovation Shares proposal would have a smaller global footprint than the other proposed and existing funds, limiting itself to only U.S. and Canadian companies that \"have a business interest\" in the legal cannabis, hemp or cannabidiol pharmaceutical and consumer wellness and product markets. (The vast majority of legal cannabis companies are domiciled in Canada.)Like the Amplify proposal, the Innovation Shares fund would implement size and liquidity screens, including a minimum market cap of $100 million and at least 200,000 shares traded during the month of the index reconstitution.Though the index is market-cap-weighted, individual securities are capped at a 7% weighting, with the excess proportionally redistributed among the remaining constituents.The index would be reconstituted monthly, on the third Friday of each month.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "First 'Zero Fee' ETF Filed",
  "parag": "Someone in ETF-land has finally won the race to zero\u2014but it wasn't by an issuer anyone expected.On Monday, online personal financial services company Social Finance, Inc. (SoFi) filed for the industry's first (effectively) zero-fee ETFs.The filing is an update of an existing fund filing made back in January, adding expense information for each of four ETFs in preparation for the funds' launches (read: \"Newcomer Tidal Plans 4 ETFs\").Fee Waivers = Zero FeesThe information became available in SoFi\u2019s latest filing for the four funds, two of which appear to be very close to launching. The products include three growth funds and a fund focused on the \"gig economy,\" and are all SoFi-branded funds:The first three funds will list on the NYSE Arca, while GIGE will list on Nasdaq.Two of the funds, SFY and SFYX, will have fee waivers in place until at least March 27, 2020, effectively bringing their total fund expenses to zero for the first year of their operation. Fees for SFYF and GIGE are not yet listed.This isn't the first time a fee waiver has made an ETF free to own. In 2016, State Street Global Advisors briefly waived expenses for its new Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE) to help ease the transition for investors in advance of a significant revision to the GICS classification standard that separated the financial services and real estate sectors.Guggenheim (now Invesco) did the same for its S&P 500 Equal Weight Real Estate ETF (EWRE) (read: \"What The New Real Estate Sector Means For ETFs\").What's different about SoFi's filing is the duration of its waiver, which will last for at least one year instead of three months. Without the waiver in place, SFY and SFYX would have an expense ratio of 0.19%Fee Wars Won?In recent years, the largest players in the fund industry have aggressively lowered the expense ratios on their funds to attract new investors. Today there are 13 ETFs that charge 0.04% and another five that charge just 0.03% offered by five firms, including Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Schwab and Invesco.Combined, these 17 ultra-low-cost ETFs brought in $69 billion in new assets last year alone, or 22% of the industry's total $315 billion net inflows for 2018 (read: \"2018's $315B ETF Inflows 2nd Largest Ever\").Fixed By Zero?Meanwhile, in September, Fidelity Investments took the fee war to a new level by launching the first zero-fee mutual funds (Read: \"Fidelity 'Fixxed' By Less Than Zero\").Unlike SoFi's filing, the Fidelity mutual funds carry zero management fees and no other expenses, making their total operating expense zero in\u00a0perpetuity.Fidelity's zero-fee suite, which now includes four equity funds, has a combined $3.36 billion in assets under management. Yet growth in Fidelity's zero-fee mutual funds is inherently limited, because only Fidelity\u00a0brokerage clients can buy them through Fidelity's own\u00a0platform.That's not the case for ETFs: With rare exceptions, most ETFs can be purchased via most brokerage platforms. If an ETF is listed on a public exchange for trade, then anybody can buy them, meaning SoFi's funds could grow without any inherent ceiling in place.The Difference An ETF MakesIntriguingly, the service providers listed in the filing include a number of smaller ETF companies, many of which already offer their own ETFs.The funds' advisor is Toroso Investments, which runs the $7 million ETF Industry Exposure & Financial Services ETF (TETF). Toroso's chief investment officer is Michael Venuto, who also serves as a managing director for Tidal Growth Consultants, the funds' administrator and also owner of the trust through which the funds are being launched. (Venuto is listed as a portfolio manager for the SoFi funds.)Exponential ETFs, meanwhile, is listed as subadvisor for the SoFi funds; Exponential has three ETFs on the market worth a combined $73 million, the largest of which is the $57 million American Customer Satisfaction ETF (ACSI). Exponential also acts as subadvisor for three ETFs from Amplify ETFs.As such, SoFi's filing suggests that smaller ETF companies may be coming to the conclusion that the best way to compete with Vanguard, Schwab and BlackRock on fees is by banding together.SoFi Branches OutSoFi's zero-fee ETF filing appears to be part of a greater expansion effort by the company to broaden its product lineup and diversify its revenue streams.Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that SoFi planned to allow customers to trade stocks and ETFs on its platform later this year. An alpha version of the technology has already gone live for employees and select customers.Launched in 2011, SoFi began as a student loan refinancing service for college students from high-priced Ivy League schools. While student loans remain the most lucrative segment of its business, the firm has also expanded into a variety of banking and loan services, including personal loans, mortgages and bank accounts. SoFi also has robo advisory and brokerage platforms.Matter Of NuanceInvestors should keep in mind that, technically, there is a difference between a fee waiver and a zero management fee. Should SoFi's fee waiver expire, investors in its zero-fee funds would be charged a 0.19% management fee. (Some ETFs carry a zero management fee, including the $63 million Cambria Global Asset Allocation ETF (GAA). However, as a fund-of-funds, GAA also charges acquired fund fees, which results in a total expense ratio for the fund of 0.33%.)Furthermore, it's worth remembering that a zero-fee ETF does not mean its total cost of ownership would be zero. Fund expense ratios are only one part of the equation: There are also trading spread costs and tracking difference to consider (read: \"Are Fidelity's Funds Really Free?\").Still, a fund price tag of effectively zero is almost sure to grab attention\u2014and assets\u2014for this ETF industry newcomer.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]."

  "parag": "Choppy seas in equities have been good for gold\u2014and gold miners.On Wednesday, the gold price hit a 10-month high of $1,346.80/ounce, as investors sought a safe-haven hedge against geopolitical uncertainty and rising interest rates.But rising gold prices aren't just good for holders of bullion. They also spell good news for the miners bringing the precious metal out of the ground, who benefit from increased profitability and higher operating leverage.Several gold miner ETFs have topped our best performers' list over the last 30 days , including the Sprott Junior Gold Miners ETF (SGDJ), up 21% over the past month; the ETFMG Prime Junior Silver ETF (SILJ), up 19%; and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ), up 17%.But we think the most interesting action this week happened in the $11 billion VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX).High Volumes For A High Vol Fund\nThe fund\u2014which is by far the largest gold miners ETF and one of the largest ETFs, period\u2014saw trading volumes spike on Tuesday, with about $2 billion worth of shares exchanging hands in one day, \u00a0Bloomberg reported.That's more than twice the ETF's usual daily volume, and more than any other fund had traded that day.However, GDX is no stranger to high trading volumes. The fund, which tracks an index of global gold and other precious metals miners, is one of the most well-traded ETFs around, with deep primary and secondary liquidity and a vibrant options market. On average, the fund trades more than 42 million shares daily. (Read: \"15 Most Actively Traded ETFs.\")Over the past month, GDX has risen 15%. While that's a solid rise, it's less than the jump seen by the junior miner ETFs listed above, in part because GDX tracks larger, so-called \"major\" miners that are less nimble than smaller, more volatile \"junior\" plays.Intriguingly, though, over the same period GDX has seen outflows of $281 million. But over a one-year period GDX has brought in $2.8 billion in net inflows:Source: ETF.com. Data as of Feb. 21, 2019.M&A Activity Ramping Up?\u00a0 \nGDX's largest weightings are in Barrick Gold Corp (11%), Newmont Mining (NEM) (8%) and the Franco-Nevada Corp. (6%). More than half (58%) of the fund's portfolio is in Canadian firms.In recent months, there's been a pick-up in M&A activity among gold miners, with Barrick Gold merging with Randgold Resources and Newmont Mining buying Goldcorp. That's because many major gold miners are finding that M&A is an easier way to boost their balance sheet than by finding new, untapped reserves.Only time will tell if rising gold prices will lure the majors back to the picks and shovels, however.GDX costs 0.53%, making it the second cheapest gold miner ETF, after the iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF (RING), which costs 0.39%.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]."

  "topic": "Using ETFs To Beat A Future Recession",
  "parag": "We recently spoke with Stephen Blumenthal, the ETF strategist heading CMG Capital Management Group in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, on the sidelines of Inside ETFs this month. The well-known tactical asset manager said one of four key recession signals is now flashing, even if a potential recession may still be several months off. Luckily for ETF investors, there are plenty of tools with which to manage looming risk, including some fresh innovation in the ETF space.\u00a0ETF.com: At Inside ETFs, a lot of the conversation centered on the macroeconomy, on concerns about a recession. Are they overblown? As a tactical investor, what\u2019s your big-picture view? Steve Blumenthal: The reason recession is so important for all of us investors is that that's when the bad stuff happens. You get the massive amounts of defaults. High yield and debt markets really come unglued, especially the higher risk. The equity markets' average decline is 37% in all the recessions that have happened since 1950. The last two recessions saw a 50% decline in markets.Because of how high the debt is within our system, how high margin accounts are, how high corporate debt is, how high we are relative to all times in history, when you have a recession, it's very hard for people to find funding. Businesses are operating on borrowing and suddenly can no longer borrow; liquidity dries up.ETF.com: What signals do you look at specifically to assess the risk of a recession\u2014one that would cause you to reallocate assets?Blumenthal: There are ways for us to get in front of a recession.Once a month, I post the latest recession charts. I've got four recession-watch charts. The first one is employment trends. There's an employment trend index, and it's measuring whether employment trends are increasing, and businesses are hiring, so things are good. When it's decreasing, then something's happening. We're starting to deteriorate on that chart. When the employment trends index drops by roughly 4% from any high, you start to get concerned. That's an economic contraction signal. When it starts to rise by about 1% from a low, it's an expansion signal.This signal has avoided every recession since 1980. It typically has some lead time, so when you start to see that move, recession usually follows, but not right away.Another chart looks at the stock market, which is a leading economic indicator, and rolls over and tops prior to recessions. This chart actually fired a sell signal\u2014or a recession signal\u2014at the end of January. Specifically, you\u2019re looking at the five-month moving average of the S&P 500 Index. If it declines by about 4.5% from any high, you start to get concerned. That's a contraction signal. Now, that indicator has an 80% accuracy rate since 1978. So, for now, just keep the lights on.We also follow the yield curve. When it inverts\u2014meaning the short-term yield is higher than the 10-year yield\u2014something's messed up in the system. You should be rewarded for owning longer bonds than shorter-duration bonds. It has a high accuracy rate, and typically a 12- to 14-month lead time to recession when it inverts. At the end of January, we were just 13 basis points from inverting. Since then, it's backed off a little bit, but should be watched.The last one follows lending conditions, meaning, can people get a loan? If you've got this huge maturity calendar, companies are borrowing, individuals are borrowing\u2014when credit conditions are good, we can refinance, we can continue to party on. When credit conditions invert, they're bad. Currently, the lending conditions are strong. I see no immediate risk as it relates to that indicator. That also has a very high accuracy rate.The Stock Market and the EconomyFor a larger view, please click on the image above.\u00a0The Employment Trends Index and the EconomyFor a larger view, please click on the image above.\u00a0NDR Credit Conditions IndexFor a larger view, please click on the image above.\u00a0Yield Curve Recession IndicatorFor a larger view, please click on the image above.\u00a0Global Recession Watch IndicatorFor a larger view, please click on the image above.\u00a0ETF.com: Do you need all four indicators to turn to say recession is really here?Blumenthal: I'm a weight-of-the-evidence kind of person. I'm looking at the odds. And when you start seeing several of these things line up, you get really concerned.I wouldn't just trade on the stock market indicator. And part of the reason is that we know what happened in the fourth quarter of last year. That's largely why that fired a signal.But the Fed has made a complete U-turn in a month in policy. There's some sort of footing by Fed policy to the downside of the market. So I wouldn't use that as my only indicator to say \u201clet's hedge everything we've got.\u201d But it\u2019s a warning. So far, I see no recession in six months.ETF.com: As an asset manager, when do you start reallocating, going defensive, possibly giving up some upside potential? Blumenthal: There are multiple ways to manage risk. I like to diversify to trading strategies.Somebody might follow a 200-day moving average as a risk-off/risk-on type of measure; somebody might say that when this recession evidence has advanced, we\u2019ll do things to reduce exposure; and some will use the wonderful world of ETFs to find other types of ETFs that might do better. For example, value plays, which have been completely out of favor, probably will outperform relative to growth plays. You kind of de-risk your portfolio that way.ETF.com: We\u2019ve seen a lot of new ETFs come to market, some focused on portfolio defense. What kind of ETF innovation is on your radar?Blumenthal: There's a company here that we'll all learn an awful lot more about over the course of the next five years, almost where Rob Arnott was with fundamental indices. What they do is, they have coded\u2014think of DNA coding\u2014every company in the S&P 500 by business risks. They look at a company and say, \u201cHow do they make their money? Who's their customer? How do they transport it? What type of business are they in?\u201d You end up with a long trait of what that company is and how they make their money.Then you can say, \u201cWhere am I concentrated with similar business risks?\u201d Because it's not just sector versus something else; it's deeper. What is the DNA of a company?Using that stratified process, you end up owning the same constituents of the S&P 500, but in a healthier way so that you're not overconcentrated specific business risks. In cap weight, you were overconcentrated technology in 1999. In cap weight, you were overconcentrated financials in 2007.Thus by rule and structure, you just own the same things, but in a different weighting structure. The company is Syntax, and it\u2019s doing something really innovative. I think what it\u2019s created is real beta, and you get a healthier allocation across the market.Its first ETF is the Syntax Stratified LargeCap ETF (SSPY).ETF.com: Does this stratified weighting approach offer any more downside-risk protection than a market-cap ETF in the event of a recession? Blumenthal: It's better when the markets get riskier. It doesn't mean that if the market's down 50%, SSPY doesn\u2019t face that risk. But what tends to happen is, pockets where overconcentration is might not snap back as quickly, like technology didn't in post-2000 to 2010. ETFs like this tend to come back better.ETF.com: How willing are you to jump into a brand-new ETF, such as SSPY, right out of the gate? Blumenthal: Great question. If it's a small ETF, we have a lot of concerns, even if it's highly liquid. We're worried about whether that ETF or the company behind it can survive. You do some due diligence as to where those risks are. We trade only highly liquid ETFs, and the liquidity is tied to the underlying, and as long as the fee is attractive.Oftentimes with a small ETF, somebody's paying that admin fee if there's not enough AUM in the ETF to make enough money, so it's coming out of the issuer's pocket. I want to make sure the company is solid, there's enough size in it and there\u2019s enough liquidity. Then, I'm good.Contact Cinthia Murphy at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "New Ways To Invest In Retail ETFs",
  "parag": "The past couple of weeks had something for everyone when it comes to retail. A pair of high-profile releases offered conflicting views on the health of American retailers, confusing the outlook for the industry. Last Thursday, the Census Bureau reported that U.S. retail and food service sales in December tumbled 1.2% from November to December, the steepest monthly decline since 2009. Even e-commerce, usually a consistent bright spot for sales, fared poorly in December, slipping 3.9% month-over-month. Understandably, the $265 million SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), one of the largest retail ETFs on the market, fell on the news, losing 0.20%.\nThings were looking gloomy for retail, but not for long. On Tuesday, Walmart, the largest retailer in the world and a bellwether for retailers at large, reported blowout sales, lifting spirits for the entire group. XRT climbed 0.50% on Tuesday and another 0.15% on Wednesday, putting the ETF up 11.4% on a year-to-date basis.Look Past Single Data Point\nClearly, last week\u2019s dismal retail sales data didn\u2019t have much of a lasting market impact. But how does one reconcile the weak December figures with the rosy outlook from Walmart and the bullish price action in XRT? Well, for one, December\u2019s retail sales data was just that\u2014a single data point for a single month. Retail sales for 2018 as a whole and even just the fourth quarter, were much stronger. The Census Bureau says that sales were up 3.7% year-over-year in Q4 and 2.3% year-over-year in 2018. That matches what Walmart said. The firm\u2019s same-store sales in Q4 rose 4.2%, a bit more than the whole industry, but not that far off. In other words, the December data notwithstanding, retail sales aren\u2019t falling off a cliff. That also jives with other economic data, such as nonfarm payrolls and business surveys, which suggest steady growth in the U.S. economy.E-Commerce Still Dominating  Before you get too enthusiastic about the retail rebound, things have to be put in perspective. XRT is still a ways from its all-time high\u201413%\u2014compared to only 5% for the S&P 500. What\u2019s more, the ETF hasn\u2019t really made much headway since 2015. Since topping out about four years ago, the fund has essentially been rangebound. This is in large part because of the struggles that brick-and-mortar retailers have faced in the face of the growing e-commerce threat. Indeed, Walmart\u2019s strong fourth quarter was in large part due to strong online sales, which surged 43%. The data for the full year isn\u2019t in yet, but the Census Bureau estimates that total e-commerce sales through the first three quarters of 2018 were up 14.5%, three times the growth rate of retail sales as a whole.Brick-And-Mortar Bankruptcies\nThese figures do nothing to change the prevailing narrative that e-commerce is eating the lunch of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Some of the old guard, like Walmart, are adapting. But others, such as Sears, Office Depot, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and many others have struggled in the new era. According to CB Insight, since 2015, 57 major retailers declared bankruptcies, due to \u201cstruggling physical storefronts, massive debt, and inefficient operations, among other issues.\u201d With e-commerce still only making up 1/6ath of all retail sales, there\u2019s a case to be made that online sales will continue to grow briskly at the expense of physical storefronts, weighing on shares of many retail stocks, and by extension, ETFs.E-Commerce ETF\nWith such a stark outlook for retail, investors may be wondering whether there\u2019s a better way to invest in the space. Perhaps there is. The Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY) holds a basket of stocks that derive the majority of their sales from online\u2014at least 75%. It\u2019s a way to bet on the growth in e-commerce while shunning traditional brick-and-mortar retailers IBUY holds nearly $300 million in assets under management, which is more than XRT. The strategy has paid off. Since its inception in Apr. 2016, IBUY is up 88.9%, easily outpacing the 4.3% gain in XRT during the same time period.\u00a0IBUY vs XRT PerformanceSource: BloombergAUM For IBUY (Blue) And XRT (Orange)Source: BloombergNew Choices \nIBUY\u2019s success has naturally spawned competing e-commerce-focused ETFs such as the $32 million ProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN) launched last July. While the two funds hold similar names and limit international exposure at 25%, they have drastically different weighting schemes. IBUY is equal-weighted, while ONLN is market-cap-weighted. The effect of cap-weighting is particularly pronounced in ONLN; Amazon and Alibaba account for a whopping 39.4% of the fund. \u00a0 Meanwhile, the newest entrant into the space, the $1.6 million Global X E-commerce ETF (EBIZ) stretches its exposure outside of online retailers themselves. Software and service companies that facilitate e-commerce, like Shopify, are included in its holdings.Aggressive Options \nFinally, for investors or traders who want to take an even more aggressive position in the rise of e-commerce and/or the demise of brick-and-mortar retailers, there\u2019s a pair of products that help with that. The aptly named $5 million ProShares Decline of the Retail Store ETF (EMTY) provides inverse exposure to an index of retail companies that receive more than three-quarters of their revenue from in-store sales. Its sister product, the $46 million ProShares Long Online/Short Stores ETF (CLIX) combines 50% of that inverse exposure with 100% long exposure to a basket of e-commerce stocks. The long/short ETF has done pretty well since inception in Nov. 2017, gaining 19.5%. On the other hand, the pure inverse fund has lost 13.4% in the same period.Performance For EMTY And CLIXSource: BloombergEmail Sumit Roy at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or follow him on Twitter\u00a0sumitroy2"

  "parag": "In an editorial published this week in The New York Times, a commissioner with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a professor at the University of California advocate for more transparency and accountability in the role of index providers.While pointing out that trillions of Americans\u2019 investment dollars track index investments, they muse that there are significant conflicts of interest and little regulatory scrutiny tied to these indices. CFRA agrees that what\u2019s inside the index behind an ETF or mutual fund is not obvious without doing some homework.The three largest U.S.-listed ETFs\u2014SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u00a0(VOO) \u2014track the prominent S&P 500 index run by S&P Global as do more than 100 mutual fund share classes. Price competition is so intense in the index fund world that the Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX) charges a tiny 0.02% expense ratio.Index Methodology Matters\nThe editorial authors remind readers that the \u201c500\u201d is chosen by a committee without providing much justification for their concern of the \u201cpower they wield over markets.\u201d The op-ed article also expresses concern about \u201cthe rise of highly customized indexes, which are developed for the use of a single fund.\u201dIndeed, there are dozens of smaller ETFs that track slices of the S&P 500 based on a distinct set of rules that focus on unique fundamental or trading patterns. While the indexes behind these ETFs have a history that can be scrutinized, we think most investors never thought about such an index until they learned of the ETF.For example, Invesco S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (XRLV) tracks an index that screens for stocks with low volatility characteristics only after removing stocks that performed poorly in prior rising interest rate environments. Our research highlights XRLV has less utilities exposure than many other low-vol strategies.Meanwhile, AAM S&P 500 High Dividend Value ETF (SPDV) tracks an index of companies with an above-average dividend yield and strong free cash flow generation, in an attempt to avoid value traps. Some of SPDV\u2019s largest holdings include utilities, such as AES and Centerpoint Energy.Self-Indexing Grows\nYet, in an increasingly competitive index-based fund world, asset managers have looked to bring down the price of their existing or newly launched funds. To do so, they have often leveraged their broader in-house resources by tracking a proprietary index.Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV) tracks the aptly named Fidelity High Dividend Index, a custom multi-cap index of companies with high dividend yields that are expected by Fidelity to continue to pay and increase the dividend. Compared to many other dividend ETFs, FDVV has a healthy weighting to information technology stocks, with Apple and Microsoft among its top positions.(Find ETFs By Holdings Using ETF.com\u2019s ETF Stock Finder.)Another example of a firm using its in-house resources to develop a unique index is SSGA. While the firm still offers SPY for 0.09%, the asset manager changed the name and the index behind SPDR Portfolio Large Cap ETF (SPLG) in late 2017 as part of its low-cost rebooting of its asset allocation lineup.Tools For Investors Exist\nInstead of tracking the Russell 1000 index as it originally did, SPLG tracks a proprietary market-cap weighted index of approximately 760 large-cap U.S. stocks and now charges a modest 0.03% expense ratio, down from 0.10% in the past. By bringing the index efforts in house, CFRA believes SSGA was able to pass along the savings to its ETF shareholders.The NY Times editorial points out that index providers generally have wide leeway when choosing individual companies that make up their indexes and how they are weighted.CFRA agrees, but we remind readers that there are index methodology documents available for review and the daily transparency of holdings. Moreover, third-party tools, such as those offered by CFRA and ETF.com, make it easy for investors to understand what they are and are not holding\u2014as well as why.To bolster their point that more scrutiny is needed, the op-ed authors reference the Libor-rigging scandal in 2012 when the Justice Department revealed that influential banks had manipulated the lending rate benchmark for excess profits.Yet, CFRA thinks the asset managers and index providers behind popular funds\u2014often operating within the same firm\u2014are transparently providing a rule book that is being utilized to offer lower-cost investment alternatives than more expensive and more opaque mutual funds.We think the investment community just needs to better utilize the tools the asset management community offers them to better understand these index ETFs and mutual funds.This article originally published on MarketScope Advisor on February 20, 2019.

  "parag": "[Editor\u2019s Note: The following originally appeared on\u00a0FactSet.com.\u00a0Elisabeth Kashner\u00a0is director of ETF research and analytics for FactSet.]Asset managers looking to keep up with the ETF revolution are looking for ways to break into the ETF space. These days, the path to success seems ever narrower. Not only are the major market segments well-covered, and the potential fee revenue compressed, but market acceptance of new ideas is disappearing. Launching new funds keeps getting harder. This trend manifests in the flat pace of new launches, the increase of closures, and, in the past few years, the dominance of bespoke and in-house funded products. ETF launches are where innovation happens. Closures generally are a sign of health, as the market cleans up the flops and moves on. Closures can also signal a lack of opportunity, as they can indicate the limits of investor interest in a segment or strategy.Over the past five years, the pace of ETF launches has flattened out, but the closure rate has increased. The joint launch/closure ratio, as shown in the chart below, indicates that asset managers\u2019 sense of opportunity has diminished, while the willingness to throw in the towel has increased.\u00a0(For a larger view, click on the image above)\u00a0Sticking With Established ETFs  The decline in the pace of launches is not the only factor limiting success of new entrants in the ETF marketplace. New launches face increasing constraints on growth, as investors largely ignore them in favor of established funds. More and more, newly launched funds gather only minimal assets in their first year. Worse, a large majority of new launches close or get trapped by their low AUM. The mountain chart below shows fund asset levels on their first birthday, sorted into bands, by year. The number of funds that accumulate less than $50 million or close up shop in their first year has been growing steadily since 2003.\nFor example, 81% of funds that launched in 2018 had less than $50 million in assets by the close of the year, while only 2% cracked the billion-dollar mark. The market has been getting tougher for years.\u00a0(For a larger view, click on the image above)\u00a0While many asset managers expect inflows after a fund achieves a certain level of seasoning, perhaps three or five years, the data shows that such expectations are largely unmet. It turns out that fund assets at the 12-month mark are strongly predictive of current asset levels, as a study of all funds launched between 2007 and 2016 reveals. This next series of charts answers the question \u201cwhere are they now?\u201d by comparing asset levels at each fund\u2019s first birthday with December 2018 levels. Of the ETFs that had less than $50 million in assets at one year, 44% have since closed, with another 30% stuck in the under $50 million range.\u00a0Funds That Had Accumulated Less Than $50 Million After Their First Year(For a larger view, click on the image above)\u00a0This next chart shows the opposite case: the present-day fate of funds that had $1 billion or more in assets under management at the 12-month mark. Just a handful closed while over three-quarters stayed in the billion-dollar-plus zone.\n\u00a0Funds That Had Accumulated More Than $1 Billion After Their First Year(For a larger view, click on the image above)Simple Equation When It Comes To Assets"

  "parag": "Charles Schwab Investment Management (CSIM), one of the biggest ETF managers in the country and one of the fastest growing, is about to welcome a new CEO. Jonathan de St. Paer will take over the reins from current CEO Marie Chandoha next month. On the sidelines of Inside ETFs last week, we caught up with de St. Paer to talk about what\u2019s working for CSIM and where he\u2019s hoping to lead the company next.ETF.com: Where has growth come from at CSIM in recent months? Jonathan de St. Paer: Here\u2019s the big picture: ETFs are a really important part of it, but there's a lot more that happens in addition to ETFs.In late 2017, we had about $300 billion in assets under management, and today CSIM oversees over $380 billion\u20142018 was a really big growth year for us.At the end of 2017, we had $99 billion in ETFs. Now we have over $126 billion; in 2018, we had about $26 billion of inflows. That's the highest growth rate of any of the top 10 ETF managers, and CSIM is now the fifth-largest ETF manager.ETF.com: Are lower fees on mutual funds an effort to deter investors from switching to ETFs? ETFs have been loss leaders for Schwab, so what\u2019s the rationale behind bringing down mutual fund fees as well? de St. Paer: Fundamentally, you'll hear me talk about three things: simplicity, scale and service.When it comes to simplicity, in some ways, it\u2019s about listening to our clients and asking them what their biggest needs are. We don't want to do all things; we want to do a limited number of things really well. And we want to do them in ways that scale.From that perspective, the need a client has for U.S. large-cap exposure or international exposure, or aggregate bond, is not an ETF need or a mutual fund need; it\u2019s a need for the exposure. We don't want our pricing to incent them to go into one vehicle over another. It's the same tool in their tool kit, and it's just a slightly different way of getting it. We thought it would be important and a big step to be able to bring the pricing down as low as we had on ETFs.But an important part of that, as well, is that we eliminated all investment minimums, offering a single share class, and that sparked a lot of the growth in the index mutual fund side, and really brought the funds and ETFs to parallel in terms of their value proposition.Fundamentally now it comes down to which vehicle is right for your preference.ETF.com: Have asset flow trends changed within CSIM after the pricing move? de St. Paer: We found that those who were comfortable where they were tended to stay there. ETFs are still growing faster than index mutual funds, but we still have about $75 billion in index mutual fund assets.In indexing, we manage $200 billion, which includes roughly $125 billion in ETFs and $75 billion in index mutual funds\u2014it\u2019s still a very big asset base and a very big part of our business.What was interesting was that more small and midsize institutions began asking us to bid or have conversations around the index mutual fund space because of the lack of share class. That move got a response. We saw a lot of 401(k) plans and a lot of smaller and midsize institutions talk to us more, and that's been part of that growth as well.ETF.com: In ETFs, Schwab has focused on core, on \"simple is better.\" Will that suffice to fuel enough ETF growth and potentially displace the likes of BlackRock? de St. Paer: There's a two-part answer: 95% of the assets in the ETF space are in U.S. equities, international equities and U.S. fixed income. The majority tends to be in core-kinds of market-cap categories, in ETFs with expense ratios of 0.10% or less.Assets and flows tend to be in those core categories where being simple\u2014meaning transparent, straightforward\u2014matters. So, yes, we do think core simplicity can drive a lot of growth.The second part of that answer is that the risk with that is that \u201cwhat's core\u201d changes over time. We think emerging markets are a core component of a portfolio, but 20 years ago, that point of view may not have been.How is core going to evolve? Focusing on the core doesn't mean you never change; it doesn't mean you never launch new product. It means we're extremely diligent about understanding what clients are looking for, how they're going to use it in a portfolio, and what aligns with our capability.The core in the simple products do have a lot more room for growth, but it can't come with blinders.ETF.com: As you take the CEO post in March, what\u2019s going to be your footprint in this space?de St. Paer: What I think is exciting is that the world in the next three years is going to be very different from the world in the last three. The market's going to be different.We're not going to have a nine-, 10-year bull market the way we have had. We\u2019re probably going to see more volatility. Clients are going to behave in a different way. Competition's only going to increase. The role of technology is only going to evolve, requiring more investment and more judgment on where to invest and where not to.Contact Cinthia Murphy at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "parag": "Mo Haghbin is head of product within OppenheimerFunds\u2019 Beta Solutions business. He is responsible for leading research and development of new investment solutions, including smart-beta ETFs. ETF.com recently discussed with him Oppenheimer\u2019s approach to ETFs.ETF.com: What is Oppenheimer's goal in terms of developing ETFs?Mo Haghbin: Since the acquisition of VTL, which was a small ETF sponsor out of Philadelphia a few years ago, our focus has been very much in this category between active and broad-based or cheap beta.Initially, we focused on expanding the revenue-weighted suite, which is just another way of thinking about fundamental indexation. It\u2019s using a fundamental metric\u2014be it revenue, cash flow, earnings or something else\u2014to reweight an index. That's fundamental indexation.The second big category we focused on has been factor-based strategies\u2014both single and multifactor. Our single-factor strategies are in a partnership with FTSE Russell. Our multifactor strategies, which are unique to the market, are a partnership between our active teams and our index provider.ETF.com: You\u2019re known for your revenue screens. When you incorporate multifactor, which factors are you talking about? Haghbin: In the multifactor products we launched last year, we look at common factors such as size, value, momentum, quality and low volatility. How we bring those into the portfolio is very unique.We\u2019re not saying you should equally own all of those factors; we're saying factors are cyclical. Therefore, they\u2019re influenced by the macroeconomic environment and overall capital market conditions. You shouldn't necessarily own all of them at all times evenly.For example, in periods where the economy is expanding\u2014GDP growth is above trend, jobs reports are healthy, manufacturing surveys are coming back positive\u2014the factors that work well in that environment are very different from the factors that work well in a contractionary or slowdown environment. This concept of defensive factors versus pro-cyclical factors is how we think about our suite.ETF.com: Is it one versus the other, or is it just a matter of evolution to get to all those?Haghbin: We first launched single-factor strategies. That's for people to do it themselves. If you wanted to build a portfolio of factors, you could say, \u201cI want low vol and I want quality and I want size. I'm done; I'm going to do those equal weighted.\u201dWe also offered our own version of multifactor, which takes into account cyclicality. It's built in to the rules of the index where, on a monthly basis, we take a read of how the economy is doing. We try to understand whether we're in an expansionary environment or a slowdown environment. And then we tilt to the factors that have historically been rewarded in those environments.ETF.com: Which tickers are we talking about here specifically in this kind of sliding macro factor?Haghbin: Those would be the Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor ETF (OMFL) and the Oppenheimer Russell 2000 Dynamic Multifactor ETF (OMFS).For example, last year the economy moved from an expansionary environment into a slowdown environment. OMFL upweighted low volatility and quality because those are the more traditional defensive factors.If you look at the performance of that product, over the summer and through October, where volatility had picked up significantly, we added our largest amount of excess return since inception because we were more defensive with our factor positioning.ETF.com: Do you see these as more of a loss mitigator or a performance booster?Haghbin: If I had to characterize it, just using this year as an example, I would say these are lower risk. The downside protection has been much bigger than the upside participation.ETF.com: What is the theme behind OppenheimerFunds ETFs? What are you trying to do?Haghbin: We like to think about it as blending active insights with the virtues of indexation, bringing together the benefits of both. We call this smart beta, but in reality, it's rules-based active.We're creating rules-based approaches to provide a better outcome for clients, whether that be risk mitigation or performance improvement. But instead of doing that on a discretionary basis, we're doing that with a set of rules in a systematic fashion, repeatable processes into the future.ETF.com: Where is the human element in the rules-based approach here?Haghbin: It\u2019s in the development of the model, which then becomes the index.ETF.com: So the index is not active, per se.Haghbin: It isn\u2019t active in the traditional sense of someone picking up the phone and saying, \u201cI want more duration,\u201d or \u201cI want this stock.\u201dThere is a little bit of a misconception that the rules never change. The rules can change every couple of years if there's something structural that needs to be improved. The point is that you stick to the recipe, you take a rules-based approach in a repeatable process and you implement it into the portfolio.If the rules are going to change, there has to be a very high bar around those rules changing. It can't just be me making that decision on my own, unilaterally. There's a governance process around it.ETF.com: Your ETFs are equity concentrated. Are you looking at product development in fixed income?Haghbin: We are, but we're starting from a different base. The future is taking some of the work that we've done in equities\u2014factors in equities are a very, very well-understood, well-researched concept\u2014and taking that over into fixed income and creating solutions there that also try to deliver a better result.ETF.com: There's not really a revenue factor in fixed income. What factors in fixed income would you be focused on?Haghbin: We don't think about revenue as a factor on the equity side either. We just think of revenue as a subset of value, as a way of capturing value. But on the fixed-income side, you're absolutely right. Duration and spread are the two biggest drivers of performance in fixed income.Now, can you take advantage of momentum in bonds? Sure. Can you think about relative value? Of course you can. But the definitions are different. When we think of value on equities, we think price-to-book. When we think about value in fixed income, we're looking at richness and cheapness based on price and yield.The definitions are different, but the concepts aren\u2019t. The concepts are taking advantage of opportunities by these concepts that active managers have been thinking about and developing over the years, and systematizing them in a way that becomes repeatable.Drew Voros can be reached at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "Strong Demand For Muni ETFs",
  "parag": "After a rocky start to 2018, the municipal bond market rallied to finish up as the fifth-consecutive year, and is up so far this year.\u00a0\u00a0Demand for municipal bonds has been very strong. Expect that to continue as tax-paying individual investors (especially those in the high-tax states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut) begin to understand the dollars-and-cents impact resulting from the new limitation on the deductibility of state and local taxes (the SALT deduction) from their federal taxes. The interest in tax-exempt income will go higher.(We calculate that even with the reduction in the maximum federal individual income tax rate from 39.6% to 37%, the cap on the SALT deduction means the combined state and federal maximum effective income tax rates went up in seven states: California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina and Wisconsin.)Municipal Bond ETF Assets GrowWhile the municipal bond market has long been dominated by the demand for individual bonds, the appetite for professionally managed products has grown and the market for muni ETFs has grown as well: Out of the 47 muni ETFs currently available, all but 10 grew in assets last year.So far this year (through Feb. 13), 24 muni ETFs have grown in assets, while 12 have lost assets. The other measure of investor activity is trading, and year-to-date, the overall pace of muni ETF trading (based on market value traded) is more than 45% heavier than last year. (YTD average daily trading is running at $393 million, compared with $270 million per day in 2018.)\u00a0\u00a0Green Returns Across Muni ETFsFor 2018, the majority of the muni ETFs had positive returns, led by the high-yield ETFs\u2014which was the best-performing credit sector last year, and through the end of January, only two of the 47 municipal bond ETFs had negative total returns, and those two funds are ultra-low-duration funds that are most sensitive to the changes in short-term rates. (They were the Invesco VRDO Tax-Free Weekly ETF (PVI) and the First Trust Ultra Short Duration Municipal ETF (FUMB.)In January, the top five most actively traded ETFs captured 71% of the total trading volume. In 2018, those five funds had 69% of total volume. They were the iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB), the SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond ETF (TFI), the Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond ETF (VTEB), the iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF (SUB) and the SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Short Term Municipal Bond ETF (SHM).As we have suggested here before, tactical investors contemplating the use of a muni ETF as a tool for temporarily implementing a particular view may wish to focus on the largest and most actively traded muni ETFs, such as the ones listed above.Investors seeking core \u201cbuy and hold\u201d-type exposure to municipals through ETFs can expand their search to include some of the other funds, but should be mindful of their own future liquidity needs and be comfortable with the liquidity of any ETF they are considering.Extending DurationWith the market now pricing in a much lower risk of a 2019 rate hike by the Federal Reserve, some investors may be more willing to extend duration. However, our U.S. Strategy team sees \"room for wage inflation surprises as 2018's strong employment growth has continued to tighten the labor market.\"So, while tactical investors may see incremental yields available by extending within their duration targets as attractive, they should be prepared to be nimble should inflation indicators move higher.Long-term buy-and-hold investors who have been underweighting duration may wish to move some of that to slightly longer durations where they can be comfortable that they are earning a positive real return (yield minus the inflation rate).The Bloomberg BVAL triple-A municipal benchmark curve hits 2% around the 11-year maturity, so investors in lower-rated credits should expect to earn a positive real return, i.e., a yield higher than the 2% inflation rate, in the seven- to 10-year range, depending on credit quality and the state of issuance.The chart below plots the 13 most actively traded municipal bond ETFs versus the Bloomberg triple-A rated municipal market benchmark yield curve. (The Invesco Taxable Municipal Bond ETF (BAB) is excluded, since it tracks the taxable municipal bond market.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0State-Specific ExposureCalifornia: the iShares California Muni Bond ETF (CMF) or the Invesco California AMT-Free Municipal Bond ETF (PWZ); as of 2/13, the iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB) had 21% exposure to California bonds, and the SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Short-Term Municipal Bond ETF (SHM) had 19% exposure.New York: In addition to the iShares New York Muni Bond (NYF), these funds had at least 20% exposure to New York munis as of 2/13: MUB (23%), PWZ (26%), the Xtrackers Municipal Infrastructure Revenue Bond ETF (RVNU) with 23% and VTEB (20%, as of 12/31/18).Other Interesting ETFsTaxable municipal bonds: BABInfrastructure/revenue bonds: RVNU tracks an index of bonds secured by revenues from infrastructure projects, such as water and sewer, public power, toll roads, etc.Short-term alternative: PVI invests primarily in variable rate demand obligations, which often pay higher yields than money market funds, but which are typically issued in denominations of $100,000, so this fund provides access to this product with much lower minimumsPatrick Luby is the senior municipal strategist with CreditSights Inc.

  "topic": "Outlook For Fixed Income ETFs In 2019",
  "parag": "The Federal Reserve may be on pause, but there\u2019s no way to know with certainty what its next move will be.Global growth is slowing now, but that may not remain the case if the U.S. and China make a trade deal.The yield curve has flattened, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should completely shun duration in your portfolio.These were some of the points raised in an early-afternoon panel on fixed income at the Inside ETFs conference in Hollywood, Florida. Guided by moderator Tom Lydon, five fixed-income experts discussed a broad range of topics over 50 minutes, including advice on how investors should position their portfolios in 2019.Is The AGG Flawed?An area of disagreement among the panelists concerned whether the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index is flawed. William Housey, senior portfolio manager at First Trust Advisors, and Gene Tannuzzo, deputy global head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, argued that the AGG is indeed flawed.\u201cIt makes up less than half of the global bond market, and the yield-versus-duration combination doesn\u2019t seem attractive,\u201d argued Tannuzzo, while noting that the AGG\u2019s yield of 3% and duration of six years weren\u2019t compelling.Tannuzzo and Housey suggested that using active or rules-based alternatives to the AGG could result in better outcomes for investors.On the other hand, Jason Singer, head of fixed-income ETFs at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, had a different perspective.\u201cI don\u2019t think the benchmark is flawed,\u201d he said. Rather, it\u2019s about what end-users want.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a blunt instrument, [ETFs tied to the AGG] get that exposure at a price point,\u201d Singer added. \u201cTo the extent people are looking to change that market risk, that\u2019s where active management comes into play. One is about exposure, one is about exposure plus alpha. It depends what you\u2019re looking for.\u201dLiquidityA big concern about fixed-income ETFs has been the idea that when markets turn volatile, liquidity will dry up, leading to a breakdown in those products that hold relatively illiquid underlying securities.But the panel argued that those concerns are overblown and that the action in December proves it. Rather than run away from those types of fixed-income ETFs in December, investors embraced them, and actually used them for liquidity.Overall, fixed-income ETFs had inflows of more than $16 billion in December, and $15.5 billion in January, according to data from FactSet.Outlook For 2019\nWhen asked about the outlook for fixed income in 2019, Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, was circumspect. \u201cThe Fed is likely on hold, but interest rates could be a lot more variable than we think,\u201d he offered. He advised investors to stay defensive, while avoiding taking equity-like risk in their fixed income portfolios. \u201cStay on the short end; don\u2019t take on too much interest rate risk; and don\u2019t take on too much credit risk in 2019,\u201d Arone added. Goldman\u2019s Singer agreed on the attractiveness of short-term rates. \u201cCash is king,\u201d he said. \u201cIn today\u2019s environment, you\u2019re getting somewhere between 2.25% and 2.75% on cash.\u201d Therefore, \u201coptimizing your cash is key.\u201d Still, he advised that owning \u201csome level of duration and high-quality duration makes sense within a portfolio in 2019.\u201d Singer believes credit could perform quite well this year, but investors should be mindful we\u2019re late in the cycle. \u201cHave strategies and filters that could weed out underperforming issuers,\u201d he suggested. Meanwhile, Columbia Threadneedle\u2019s Tannuzzo says the most important thing investors can do in 2019 is stay diversified. Cash may be attractive right now, \u201cbut If you look historically, when the yield curve is flat, the best forward returns come from long-term bonds,\u201d he noted.Additionally, investors should \u201cdiversify into credit sectors and global sectors,\u201d Tannuzzo said.The Case For High Yield\nFirst Trust\u2019s Housey had a somewhat more aggressive outlook for 2019 than the rest of the panel. \u201cThe 2019 playbook is really similar to 2016. The Fed is on pause; they\u2019re not done,\u201d he explained. \u201cRisk sentiment is going to be hinged on trade.\u201d Housey told investors to be careful with the prevailing narrative\u2014there is a global synchronized slowdown. Based on his discussions with corporate CEOs, they are waiting to see the rules on trade before they act. Once there is a trade deal with China, it\u2019s going to act like stimulus, as all of the capital that is being withheld comes back into the economy.As that happens, the dollar will weaken, boosting commodities and high yield\u2014an area he does not see as being in a bubble. Tens of billions of dollars has flowed out of high yield in recent years, evidence of a lack of euphoria in the space. On top of that, default rates are at less than 2%, making high yield compelling.Housey added that, bank loans, which have similar yields as high yield but are higher on the capital structure, may be even more appealing based on valuation.Email Sumit Roy at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or follow him on Twitter\u00a0sumitroy2"

  "topic": "12 Hidden Gem ETFs",
  "parag": "The \u201cBack to the Mine: Hidden Gems 2.0\u201d panel was a hit Monday at the Inside ETFs conference in Hollywood, Florida. Sure, there was a lot of \u201ctalking one\u2019s book\u201d as ETF issuers hailed their own offerings, but it still brought to light some interesting products that aren\u2019t often discussed.In rapid succession (three minutes each), 12 ETF insiders provided their most under-the-radar ETF ideas.Here they are:ALPS Disruptive Technologies ETF (DTEC)Everyone wants to invest in the next big technology theme, but why limit yourself to just one? The $48 million DTEC selects the top 10 most disruptive technology themes and equal-weights them.It then takes the top 10 pure-play companies within each theme and equal-weights those (they have to have more than 50% of their revenues exposed to the theme).The benefit of the strategy is that investors don\u2019t have to bet on which disruptive tech company or theme will work over time. Last year was a volatile year. The divergence in return between the top theme (health care innovation) and bottom theme (robotics and artificial intelligence)\u2014was 45%.Other themes in the DTEC basket include 3D printing, mobile payments, internet of things, clean energy, cloud computing, fintech, cybersecurity and analyticsProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN) You\u2019d have to be living under a rock to not know about the ascendance of e-commerce. Amazon is dominating, and brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling to stay alive.That said, you may be surprised to learn that online sales are still a relatively small slice of the overall retail pie. Only about 10% of retail sales happen online, according to Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares.According to him, that share is expected to grow to 25% over the next two decades, as hundreds of millions of people around the world get connected to the internet for the first time (200 million people got their first mobile device in 2017). With that growth trajectory, shares of online retailers should continue to rise, benefiting ONLN. The $33 million ETF tracks retailers that mainly sell online or through other nonstore channels. The fund is global in scope and uses a modified market-cap-weighted approach.Holdings must have a market cap of at least $500 million; the largest company is capped at 25% of the portfolio; and U.S. exposure is likewise capped at 25% of the fund.VelocityShares Long LIBOR ETN (ULBR)Betting on rising interest rates through inverse bond ETFs is great, but what if you could get exposure to interest rates directly?That\u2019s what the $11 million UBLR aims to do. It provides direct exposure to three-month dollar Libor, rising and falling by the same amount as the interest rate. If Libor increases from 2% to 2.2%, ULBR should rise by 10%.It\u2019s an interesting way to bet on an interest rate that is strongly influenced by Fed policy.Innovator S&P 500 Buffer ETF (BOCT)\u00a0Innovator S&P 500 Power Buffer ETF - October (POCT) Innovator S&P 500 Ultra Buffer ETF - October (UOCT)It\u2019s as tough to predict that market as it is to predict the weather, says Bruce Bond, co-founder and CEO of Innovator Capital Management.That\u2019s why his firm developed S&P 500 Defined Outcome ETFs, products that help investors go from hoping the market rises to knowing what their returns will be over a one-year outcome period. Bond says it\u2019s like buying the S&P 500 with a built-in buffer.Each buffer\u2014the amount of downside protection the funds seek to provide has a corresponding cap\u2014the maximum upside an investor will experience. For the October series of defined-outcome ETFs, the initial buffers were 9% with a cap of 15.3% for BOCT; and 15% with a cap of 10% for POCT, and a 30% buffer with a cap of 9.9% for UOCT.According to Bond, before fees, investors using the S&P 500 defined-outcome ETFs are going to meet or exceed the return of the S&P 500 in all market conditions, unless it exceeds the caps.Insight Shares LGBT Employment Equity ETF (PRID)PRID is an equity ETF that aims to deliver marketlike returns for socially conscious investors.According to Richard Cea, head of ETPs for UBS, employment discrimination is widespread. But those companies that discriminate against LGBT people, which together number 10 to 15 million, are at a disadvantage. The companies that don\u2019t have open policies will have a hard time attracting the best talent, he says. Companies that value diversity and hire the best, most innovative people will outperform.The $2.5 million PRID captures that innovation. It starts with the Russell 1000, removes illiquid names; removes companies that have not been profitable over the last 12 months; and selects the companies that rank the highest on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s corporate equality index.The resulting 300 companies are market-cap-weighted. Sector tilts for the fund are in line with the broad market, giving investors marketlike exposure while investing in a socially conscious way.JPMorgan Global Bond Opportunities ETF (JPGB)About 60% of the global bond market is outside the U.S., but U.S. investors on average have only 7% of their fixed-income portfolios invested globally.Enter JPGB, a way for investors to invest in the best fixed-income ideas across the globe, based on the analysis of the 280-strong J.P. Morgan investment team. The $180 million ETF has a higher yield than the Barclays Aggregate.Davis Select International ETF (DINT)If you\u2019re looking for a concentrated, actively managed portfolio of international stocks with compelling growth and value characteristics, look no further than DINT.The ETF has 32 holdings, taken from the best ideas of the Davis Advisors equity team. Thirteen countries are represented, with five-year average earnings per share growth of 20.4% and a P/E of 9.5\u2014significantly cheaper than 12.1 P/E for the benchmark.The $95 million fund avoids state-owned enterprises and focuses on two key themes: the growth of the online consumer; and the need to transport people and packages globally.Reverse Cap Weighted U.S. Large Cap ETF (RVRS)\nIf smaller companies tend to have higher returns over time, why do stocks\u2019 indices tilt toward larger companies? That\u2019s the question that nagged Phil Bak, founder & CEO of Exponential ETFs, for a long time. His analysis of the data showed that bigger companies don\u2019t go in one direction forever. Mean reversion exists in the market. From GE to Sears, old companies fall, and new companies arise to take their place. RVRS targets these new companies by giving them the biggest weighting in the fund. The smallest companies in the S&P 500 get the biggest weights and the largest companies get the smallest weights.When you reverse the cap, you systematically buy low and sell high; it lets you exploit mean reversion and exploit the gap between large cap and midcap, he says.WisdomTree CBOE S&P 500 PutWrite Strategy Fund (PUTW)\nThe nearly $240 million PUTW is a product that tracks the CBOE S&P 500 Put-Write Index. The data show that writing puts has been more lucrative than a covered-call strategy, even though the two should be equal based on options theory. Now may be a good time to consider an option-writing strategy as market volatility rises. Incorporating a put-write strategy into your portfolio may enhance returns while reducing the volatility of your portfolio.Franklin LibertyQ U.S. Equity ETF (FLQL)The problem with market timing is missing the best days. If you had missed just the five best days over the past 20 years, your returns would have been cut in half, explains Dan Muzzarelli, VP of institutional ETF business development at Franklin Templeton.That\u2019s why staying invested and staying the course is the most important thing you can do for your portfolio. FLQL, a $464 million multifactor U.S. large-cap ETF that weights stocks based on quality, value, momentum and low volatility, helps you stay invested. It has 15% lower average risk than the investment universe.Knowledge Leaders Developed World ETF (KLDW)Innovation isn\u2019t limited to just technology companies. KLDW is an innovation fund, but one that focuses on innovation across all sectors and geographies.Highly innovative companies tend to outperform, and the best way to measure innovation is by digging deep into expense ratios and finding those companies that are spending big on R&D and advertising (as a percentage of sales).The $126 million KLDW does that, and then equal-weights the stocks of companies it finds that have a big stock of \u201cknowledge capital.\u201dGraniteShares Bloomberg Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 ETF (COMB)Cheap and easy commodity exposure is what COMB aims to deliver. Compared with the average 0.72% expense ratio of the typical broad commodity ETF, COMB\u2019s 0.25% fee looks downright cheap.The $55 million ETF is also relatively hassle-free. Other broad commodity products are often structured as partnerships\u2014which distribute complicated K-1s (a headache at tax time)\u2014or ETNs, which have credit risk.COMB does away with all that. It also tracks the Bloomberg Commodity Index, a basket of 21 commodities with a 33% sector cap. Gold, natural gas and corn are the current top holdings.Email Sumit Roy at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or follow him on Twitter\u00a0sumitroy2"

  "topic": "Inside A Multifactor Emerging Market ETF",
  "parag": "Emerging market ETFs are picking up steam again. Many market outlooks coming into 2019 called for better days in emerging markets, and in January, the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) was the most popular ETF.IEMG raked in $4.23 billion in fresh net assets during a month when investors yanked $25.5 billion from U.S. equity ETFs.It\u2019s easy to see why. If the goal is to access emerging market stocks, IEMG is big, cheap, liquid and hugely popular.It\u2019s a market-capitalization-weighted total market ETF that invests in more than 2,200 emerging market stocks for a 0.14% expense ratio\u2014$14 per $10,000 invested. With this fund, you get comprehensive exposure that\u2019s diverse across countries and segments without making any specific bets. IEMG captures MSCI\u2019s view of the emerging market universe.Bigger Not Always Best-PerformingAll these traits, however, don\u2019t necessarily equate with best-in-class performance. In reality, when it comes to emerging market ETFs\u2014or any segment, for that matter\u2014there are many different approaches to slicing and dicing the space, from different weighting schemes, to sector bets, to factor picking, to options overlays, and so on. With every tilt comes a different return stream.Consider, for example, how a multifactor portfolio of emerging market stocks\u2014also offered by iShares\u2014stacks up relative to the vanilla IEMG\u2014the iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Emerging Markets ETF (EMGF), which launched in 2015.EMGF fishes in the same MSCI universe, but picks and weights emerging market stocks deliberately to increase exposure to four factors\u2014quality, value, momentum and small size. While the fund strives to keep region and sector allocations somewhat in line with the market-cap-weighted MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the strategy is designed to capture outperformance.How does a multifactor approach such as EMGF compare to a market-cap one such as IEMG? In 2018, it didn\u2019t do so well, underperforming market-neutral by 5 percentage points in a year when emerging market ETFs in general fared poorly, as the chart below shows. In this case, the smart-beta portfolio didn\u2019t offer any cushion on the downside last year.\u00a0\u00a0However, so far in 2019, we are seeing a reversal in leadership between the two funds, both of which are up this year. EMGF is ahead:\u00a0Charts courtesy of StockCharts.com\u00a0From a country and sector allocation perspective, there are some differences in these portfolios. For example:And the list goes on. Using ETFs for proxies of market performance, consider that in 2018, Chinese equities were hit hard, with mainland stocks down some 28%, and Hong Kong-listed equities down about 13% (you can look at the performance of the Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR) and the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI)).China, which was much more of a drag on portfolio returns last year, carries more weight in EMGF. India (as measured by the iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA)) was down a far more modest 6.6% last year.These stats go to show that portfolio differences can have more or less of an impact on portfolio performance depending on the size of the allocation relative to the overall mix.\u00a0IEMG PortfolioEMGF PortfolioSource: ETF.com/FactSet data\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Factor ImpactBeyond country and sector tilts, EMGF is a multifactor ETF. A closer look at the factor bets in this fund also help explain what\u2019s driving the divergence in returns relative to IEMG and the MSCI benchmark.In 2018, investors largely shunned emerging markets, but those who accessed the region seemed to look for safer bets in what\u2019s considered a riskier equity universe. From a factor perspective, according to Style Analytics data, in 2018, investors liked quality and low-volatility stocks. They also preferred higher-yielding and large-cap names.In the case of EMGF specifically, its focus on quality was helpful to portfolio performance, but the fund\u2019s tilt toward higher-volatility names\u2014measured on an absolute daily basis\u2014as well as its tilt toward smaller size relative to the benchmark, weighed on its performance last year.\u201cEven though EMGF doesn't necessarily call out \u2018volatility\u2019 in its model description, it\u2019s a byproduct of their model, and that didn't help in 2018,\u201d said Tom Idzal, managing director at Style Analytics. \u201cIronically, the model did a pretty good job of selecting better high-vol names, but the overall category took a beating.\u201d\u201cThis is a pretty good example of why I repeatedly say, \u2018What else does an ETF bring you beyond the headline theme or strategy\u2019?\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for anyone to have predicted that higher vol would be problematic in EM during 2018, but sometimes exposures sneak up and take a bite.\u201dNo One-Size-Fits-All SolutionIEMG has $59 billion in total assets, costs 0.14% in expense ratio and trades $1.2 billion on average a day, with an average spread of 0.02%. By comparison, EMGF has almost $300 million in total assets, costs three times as much, at an expense ratio of 0.45%, and trades $4.25 million on average a day, with an average spread 10 times as wide, at 0.22%.There\u2019s no question who\u2019s the biggest, most popular, most heavily traded and cheapest ETF of the two.But that doesn\u2019t mean IEMG is always the best one.There\u2019s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all emerging market ETF, and choices abound in a segment currently populated by 226 different ETFs. Different tilts and bets you make with different portfolios mean different return streams over time. Due diligence is key.Contact Cinthia Murphy at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "Annual ETF Survey Results",
  "parag": "Ryan SullivanVice President, ETF ServicesBrown Brothers Harriman\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a global service provider with more than $500 billion in ETF assets under custody, Brown Brothers Harriman (BBH) has a unique perspective on the industry given its centralized role within the ETF ecosystem.For the sixth year in a row, BBH has co-sponsored with ETF.com a survey of professional investors, including financial advisors, RIAs and institutional investors. Ryan Sullivan, vice president of ETF Services for BBH, discusses some of the key findings this year.ETF.com: What is the most surprising find in this year's data? What stands out? Ryan Sullivan: There are a few things that may be new themes, and some surprising emerging trends.The first one relates to ETF selection and how investors are making decisions around which ETFs they're going to buy. Historically, and especially last year, we saw expense ratio\u2014the cost of the ETF\u2014being of paramount importance in that decision. Compare that to this year's results, and cost is still important, but now it's becoming one among a handful of factors investors consider in their ETF selection.In the U.S. in particular, cost is now tied with historic returns as the most important factor when selecting an ETF. Folks are pivoting and looking at a fund's track record in addition to the fund's expense ratio when looking at an ETF. That emerged across the three regions surveyed\u2014U.S., Europe and Greater China. We\u2019re seeing that kind of pivot point between cost and track record.The third factor is the ETF's brand\u2014the ETF issuer.ETF.com: What\u2019s interesting is that we spend so much time reminding ourselves that past performance is no indication of future returns, and yet historic performance is the top factor in ETF selection right now? Why this new focus on past performance?Sullivan: Investors are getting savvier and more focused on the structure of the ETF, and the underlying strategy. Track record, cost and brand were highly rated from a selection standpoint, but so was index methodology.This tells me that investors are increasingly looking to pop the hood on ETFs, to understand the investment strategy, how it's performed over multiple market cycles, all to better understand how it may impact their portfolio if they begin allocating dollars to it. And if you combine that with the need for historic returns and information, it shows a shifting focus on an understanding that ETFs aren't always passive.While most assets are still within passively managed strategies, there's an increasing appetite for actively managed ETFs, and there's going to be more focus on the funds' historic returns there, and also with more complex smart-beta products.ETF.com: The survey found that ETFs investors are looking for more actively managed and smart-beta ETFs. Outside of fixed income, active ETFs have struggled to find a following, and some say smart beta has lost some steam. How do you reconcile that?Sullivan: When we looked at the way we positioned the questions, we were trying to get a feel for how investors might be approaching portfolio construction going forward.What their responses show in terms of demand for active, demand for smart beta, how they're using both, and what asset classes they're looking for, is that there's maybe some uncertainty as to what 2019 is going to bring from a market cycle perspective. Will we see the continued volatility we saw at the end of 2018? Will we see pullbacks on a regional basis, or are we approaching a recessionary period?We're seeing investors looking to reduce risk in their portfolio, to eliminate or reduce volatility, and for that, they\u2019re looking to use smart beta to help.Conversely, it appears that actively managed ETFs are being used more to position a portfolio to achieve some alpha and separate the beta piece with smart beta, maybe some core passive, but to seize alpha as well.I\u2019d tie that back to the demand for more choice around global equity products; for example, putting more of those into an active wrapper that may be more cost effective given the ETF structure, but one that still offers the chance for enhanced returns.ETF.com: You also found investors want more ESG ETFs, but adoption of existing ones has been pretty slow. Why is that? Sullivan: We had some interesting findings from the survey on ESG. On one hand, we saw, when we go back to the selection, ESG factors themselves were rated pretty low in importance. Index methodology itself was fairly high in comparison, so folks are certainly looking at the underlying construct of the strategy.But I think what it speaks to is that here's some uncertainty from investors as to what ESG investing actually is, especially in the U.S. where we don't have a clear set of principles. But we did see demand from a product perspective in subsequent questions, suggesting ESG demand was still a top three as you go across the regions. That shows investors are looking to continue to invest along their values.ETF.com: On the distribution side, investors said that they find accessing ETFs through ETF platforms makes for expensive and difficult ETF trading. Did that surprise you? Sullivan: That one was surprising. When we think about the maturity of the ETF market on a regional basis, I was surprised that in Europe and in the U.S., that was still cited pretty substantially from the respondents' perspective.The intermediary channels\u2014think of the broker/dealers here or the banking networks in Europe and Asia\u2014are often the providers of choice to the end investor. And investors are looking for more choice. They may be looking for different guidelines and selection criteria from those intermediaries to allow more choice.It\u2019s also a sign that maybe commissions seem to be high for trading ETFs through those intermediaries. This suggests maybe there's some room to come down. We've certainly seen a lot of that in the U.S. in recent years with some of the big discount broker/dealer platforms, the partnerships offered between some of the broker/dealers and individual ETF sponsors.Investors seem to be clamoring more for not only those reductions in commission, but maybe getting into some significant reduced commissions or waived commissions for certain parts of the ETF market.ETF.com: Overall, what\u2019s your big takeaway from this year\u2019s data? Sullivan: We talked about the emerging trend with smart beta and active. We talked about the changes in perception of cost and what else is coming in from an ETF evaluation standpoint.I think the desire for active is one that bears monitoring. We've talked a little bit about the demand for it, but we could see other things come out over time in the global regulatory environment that may continue to propel demand and create tail winds for active.If we see advancement of the ETF Rule with the SEC and what many expect to be an even playing field for the use of custom baskets, that could promote more development in the active space as well, especially around the ability to custom-negotiate certain fixed-income positions, for example, and one that could result in more products and more assets and more trading from the primary market, given their ability to understand a portfolio and hedge it appropriately.If you compare that with Europe and Greater China, transparency is still really the main focus for regulators. We have some nontransparent or semi-transparent products here in the U.S., and there are a lot of patents pending for those semi-transparent products from other shops.Europe is still waiting on that front, and right now everything has to be transparent. In Greater China, I believe only Hong Kong has actually approved the use and the viability of active ETFs. So, that's something we still think presents an outside channel growth if and when some of the other regional markets there get comfortable with actively managed ETFs.ETF.com: The flip side of that would be the issue we talked about in terms of distribution and access. There still needs to be development there.Sullivan: That's one that will continue to be fleshed out. In prior years, we've really seen a focus on education, understanding the nuances of the wrapper. The education efforts are paying off.And now I think it's a focus toward how ETF managers are working with their intermediary partners to ensure the access and the choice exists, how managers are able to get shelf space with their intermediary partners, and how end investors are able to work through their advisors or their institutional platforms to make the case that they as investors want to see more choice and more product offered. That\u2019s an area we\u2019ll be watching.ETF.com: On a final note, one data point stood out to me. The survey found that 40% of investors are willing to buy a new ETF with less than $24 million in total assets. That\u2019s hard to believe. What happened to the $100 million, three-year track record minimum we\u2019ve inherited from the mutual fund side? Are ETF investors more willing to take chances on new products? Sullivan: I've always seen ETFs as a democratizing tool in the investment landscape and one that's accessible by investors of all shapes and sizes. There's no institutional share class in the ETF land.The notion that investors understand these products, and that they're comfortable buying in, is very cool. It tells us that investors understand how ETFs work, that they're liquid, and that regardless of AUM size, they can still serve a need in the portfolio. So, they're willing to jump into the pool with them.\u00a0For a full report of our findings, visit https://www.bbh.com/en-us/etf-survey\u00a0This publication is provided by Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. and its subsidiaries (\u201cBBH\u201d) to recipients, who are classified as Professional Clients or Eligible Counterparties if in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), solely for informational purposes.

  "parag": "Wednesday, Feb. 13, 2019And that's a wrap for our Inside ETFs 2019 Live Blog! Thank you for reading, and we'll see you next time! 12:30 Swedroe starts taking audience questions. \"How do you discuss near-term struggles of strategies with clients?\" is the first one. Swedroe says he starts with the fact that every strategy has periods of underperformance, even stocks. So it goes with, say, reinsurance.Another question is about how to invest in liquid alternatives at the retail level. He mentions that there are several alternatives ETFs from Goldman and others, and there are a handful of managed futures ETFs.12:20 Where should you take this allocation to alternatives from: bonds or equities? They both have their impact on the Sharpe ratio. If you take it from bonds, you increase volatility, but essentially eliminate your inflation risk. If you take it from stocks, you might dampen your returns, but the volatility is less.\u00a0\"We recommend that if you're a high equity allocation, take it from stocks. If you're a low equity allocation, consider taking it from bonds, because you'll only increase volatility slightly but you'll increase returns a lot,\" says Swedroe. Of course, that increased risk isn't for everybody, he adds.12:15 \"The investment world is getting flatter,\" says Swedroe. A big mistake people make, he says, is they assume diversification benefits aren't there. That's just wrong. However, correlations between asset classes are on the rise, and they collapse toward 1 in times of crisis. That's why alternative sources of risk are worth looking at.Some of the alternative sources of risk he suggests include reinsurance, alternative lending, the variance risk premium, the long/short alternative style premium and managed futures. Managed futures aren't his favorite, he adds, but he says history shows you can get tail-risk protection, and he has no problem with others who might want to use it as a defensive tool in a portfolio.12:10 Swedroe shows a chart of the performance of different factors over 1-, 3-, 5-, 10- and 20-year time horizons from 1927-2017. The longer the horizon, the lower the odds of underperformance for each factor, he says. Second, no matter how long the horizon, each of the individual factors experienced some period of underperformance.\u00a0How should you think about expected returns? asks Swedroe. He lands on a theoretical 6% expected return. But \"most people make the error of thinking about that 6% in a deterministic way,\" he adds. They think they WILL earn 6%, instead of that they COULD earn 6%. So the only right way to think about expected return is to realize that expected return isn't a single point, but a bell curve. \"Don't focus on the mean,\" he adds.12:05 Swedroe walks through two example 60/40 portfolios, one with vanilla exposure and another with a lowered exposure to market beta. They have similar returns and volatility, though the one with lowered exposure performed marginally better (8.1% versus 7.8%), with lower standard deviation (7.7 to 9.0).The key is, during 2008, the worst calendar year, the lower-beta portfolio lost much less than the vanilla one. In 2008, the lower-beta one lost 8.9%, compared with the regular 60/40, which lost 19.5%.\u00a012:00 As he promised/warned, Swedroe has broken out the math. He finds that a typical 60/40 portfolio has a percentage equity risk [does math] of 86%.A 60/40 portfolio from 1928-2017 returned 8.5%. But between 1982-2017, the so-called Golden Era returned 10.4%. There were a lot of tail winds that made those years' returns higher: rising equity valuations, falling Treasury yields and doubling corporate after-tax profits. Those days are over. Investors face harsh realities now: lower expected returns, increased longevity, an increased need for long-term care, and risks to Social Security.11:55 Closing out the conference is a keynote from Larry Swedroe, director of research for Buckingham Strategic Wealth, on \"The Science of Investing: Creating Efficient Portfolios To Avoid Black Swans.\"Swedroe starts with laying out his investment philosophy at Buckingham. He believes that: 1) markets are highly efficient; 2) all risky assets should have similar risk-adjusted returns; and 3) portfolios should be broadly diversified across unique sources of risks. However, the problem is that the traditional 60/40 portfolio is typically not diversified enough by risk.11:50 Kovarsky asks, \"How do new ETF ideas get on your radar?\" It starts with the asset class, says Janocko, whether the product will fit into our portfolio or not. \u00a0Carter says ETFs come in two flavors: marketing people run the firm, and investment people run the firm. So they're interested in investment firm ETFs, and not me too style products. \"At the end of the day, we're kind of nerdy: We always look at the intellectual reasoning behind it.\"Fell, who prefers active managers, points out consistency is key. \"Before we go into it, we have to understand how they should perform in what markets.\" Simplistic managers can be the best, in fact. \"If you don't understand what you're investing in, you shouldn't be investing in it.\"11:45 \"Does the creation of the ETF change the price of the underlying?\" asks Carter. Did GLD make the underlying price of gold go up? Same with oil ETFs and crude. And if the creation of ETFs is in fact driving the price of the underlying, \"Well, that *is* a big idea.\"\"There's such a proliferation of ETFs that it's been hard to keep up,\" adds Janocko. \"It's a challenge and an opportunity. Every day there's new launches, new asset classes.\"11:40. Kovarsky notes a WSJ article finding that 92% of active managers underperform their benchmarks over five and 10 years. Kovarsky asks Fell if he's found that 8%. Fell points out the experience varies from asset class to asset class: In U.S. large-caps alone, there are 800-900 managers, of which they pick two or three.Carter comes to Fell's defense, saying that Fell's picking outside-the-box names out of those 800 names. Janocko also mentions that Fell has 40% in alternatives, while Carter offers that he invests 20% in alternatives, all of which is indexed.11:35 We pick up with \"Institutional Asset Owners & ETFs: Still In The Future?\" moderated by Paul Kovarsky, director of institutional relationships at the CFA Institute. He asks the panelists about risks facing the ETF industry.As the ETF platform gets broader and into more esoteric ideas, \"I'd hate to see some sort of trading blowup or mismatch cast a negative light on something that is good,\" says David Carter, CIO of Lenox Wealth Advisors. Joseph Janocko, senior portfolio strategist at Florida Blue, adds that we haven't seen a complete meltdown in ETFs. Case Fell, CIO of NYSNA Pension Plan & Benefits Fund, says\u00a0 ETFs can be a momentum play, in that ultimately in a downmarket, a passive benchmark will be a price-taker. Active management has the advantage of not needing to be that price-taker in a downmarket.10:50 Seymour acknowledges there are issues with liquidity, valuations and banking in the public marijuana industry today. You have to be careful, he says: \"I think cannabis companies are better priced in the private markets right now.\" Companies don't feel the need to run to the public markets in Canada, and indeed, going public has carried a bit of a stigma.The bottom line, though, is that this asset class is changing rapidly. The things people were investing in in 2018 are not the things they're investing in in 2019. In fact, the cannabis market can and assuredly will go through its own bear market.Things investors should consider when investing in Cannabis 3.0:\u00a0 What sector am I investing in? Is the company asset-heavy or asset-light? Are they an experienced operator? Am I invested in a single state or globally focused firm? Consider the balance sheet, what exchange the firm trades on, its liquidity. \"This space is changing so rapidly, you want to be active,\" he adds.10:45 The science behind the plant is \"nothing short of extraordinary,\" says Seymour. Efficacy exists now. There are dozens of ailments, from asthma to pain management, that cannabis has been proven to help treat.Hemp legalization, as part of last year's Farm Bill, paved the way for cannabis-related medical firms to enter the space and \"hang their shingle.\" But it's not just medical firms: He also predicts that at some point, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Procter & Gamble will all enter the cannabis market.10:40: The U.S. is clearly the biggest cannabis market in the world, with a $14 billion market, compared with a total $18 billion globally. California alone dwarfs the entire Canadian market. \"I think it's greater than $300 billion market globally in 10 years,\" says Seymour.On a chart, Seymour shows that 35 million people use marijuana monthly, another 20 million use it yearly. Another 78 million have tried it but don't currently use. A full 115 million adults have never tried marijuana. That's a huge untapped market, says Seymour.10:35 Last year was a watershed year for cannabis, says Seymour, with Canadian legalization and more than 30 states legalizing some form of it. Politically, marijuana is a bipartisan issue, especially in context of the rising awareness of the opioid crisis. For example, states where cannabis is legal are seeing 10-12% lower health care costs for pain management.There is also a social-awareness-component issue to legalization of marijuana, in terms of people being jailed for marijuana-related crimes. Democrat, Republican, Libertarian\u2014they have \"strong, strong support for cannabis.\"10:30 We're back this morning with the \"Big Ideas Talk: Lighting Up: The Cannabis Revolution\" with Seymour Asset Management CIO and marijuana investing expert Tim Seymour, who will explain why cannabis investing is \"for the masses and not for the stoners.\"\"Cannabis to me is just like investing in emerging markets,\" he says. Marijuana as an investment theme isn't about where you line up socially or recreationally, he adds. What's more, there's been a complete perception shift over a fairly short time: \"Like some people remember where they were when JFK got shot, I remember where I was when I heard John Boehner had joined the board of a cannabis company.\"Tuesday, Feb. 12, 20192:20 Issakainen says SPIVA is potentially misleading in that the indexes are not the best comparison for performance. Rather, active funds should be compared to passive funds because sometimes the bond index funds (he uses a high-yield example) can lag their benchmark significantly. He says that in the vast majority of fixed-income asset classes, his firm can find opportunity to add value.\u00a02:00\u00a0In \"Active Fixed-Income ETFs: For Real?\" moderated by Elisabeth Kashner, Ryan Issakainen of First Trust advises looking at sectors when looking for inefficiencies in fixed income, and notes that the assymetry of returns can be well worth the extra effort made by credit analysts. Jason Bloom of Invesco advises doing rigorous due diligence with active managers. He says an active manager can add value in an over-the-counter traded market like fixed income if they're opportunistic. He notes it's virtually impossible to build an index that's rules-based and opportunistic.\u00a0Bloom says market value weighting isn't problematic. He points out that ETF holders are not hit by panic selling the way mutual fund shareholders are.\u00a012:20 Tannuzzo advises staying diversified in 2019, and that shortening duration is not the best idea right now. Housey says the Fed is paused now and CEOs are waiting for trade deals to be finalized. When they are, it will look similar to a stimulus. Arone warns against taking equitylike risk in your fixed-income portfolio and suggests staying defensive. Singer says to optimize liquidity, be defensive in 2019 and not be afraid. Also, own some level of rate risk and don't shun credit (but\u00a0do be mindful that we are late in the cycle).12:10\u00a0Kosoff says fixed-income indexes can be more precise now. Housey says active is a better prospect than the Agg right now. Gene Tannuzzo of Columbia Threadneedle points out that the Agg is hardly aggregate, and suggests widening the opportunity set and implementing quality controls. Singer says benchmarks are not flawed\u2014it just depends on what you want. Kosoff adds that smart beta is widening the choices in fixed income and that there is a spectrum of choices in terms of levels of deviation from the benchmark.\u00a012:00\u00a0In \"Fixed Income ETFs: Analyzing the Growing Demand,\" moderated by Tom Lydon, a question about unexpected events in the fixed-income space in 2018, Michael Arone of State Street says long-term interest rates didn't go up as much as expected, while Goldman Sach's Jason Singer says \"cash is king,\" with the lesson being to optimize your liquidity and your cash. Jayni Kosoff of FTSE Russell notes that 2018 left clients needing to reposition their fixed-income portfolios. Bill Housey of First Trust was shocked by how the fear narrative took hold specifically in December. His funds had to build up liquidity buffers in case of redemptions during the turmoil. Arone notes bond investors turned to fixed-income ETFs in search of liquidity, despite many predicting investors would bail on such funds during market volatility. Singer says it's about making sure you have a plan\u2014thinking about liquidity daily as a bond manager even when the market is good.\u00a011:45\u00a0In \"It\u2019s All About the Experience: Insights From Joe Duran,\" one of the founding partners of United Capital, the speaker notes there are four pillars of client service: 1) Understanding\u2014understanding what your client cares about; 2) Personal and Interactive\u2014being accessible and in touch on their phones; 3) Predictable and Consistent\u2014providing a uniform experience whenever they interact with your firm such that they know what they are going to get; 4) Instant Gratification\u2014In a sleepy and boring industry, talk about the client's immediate life, not their future state.10:35\u00a0Ed Rosenberg of American Century Investments says multifactor ETFs are the most interesting of the factor products because there are so many ways they can be designed. Investors should understand how their products are put together and whether they align with their view of the market.\u00a010:25 In \"Figuring Out Factors: Strategies for Implementation,\" moderated by Mark Carver of MSCI, Fran Kinniry of Vanguard says selecting a factor exposure comes down to what your preference is. If you have no preference, you can use multifactor. He reminds investors that you can consider fixed income from a factor perspective.\u00a0Monday, Feb. 11, 20193:25\u00a0Zhang brings up the fact that EM fixed-income products are rare, but a few good ones do exist. Jonathan Shelon of KraneShares observes a record number of China bonds denominated in U.S. dollars were issued in 2018. He notes that such bonds are good sources of yield. Pelosky says that emerging market debt at this time is very compelling, and his firm believes emerging markets are on the verge of an easing environment.\u00a03:10\u00a0In \"How To Distinguish Value Play & Value Trap: Emerging Markets,\" moderated by Linda Zhang of Purview Investments, two issuers and two strategists discuss how to dig deeper when making emerging market investments. Jonathan Shelon of KraneShares says there's a 10-year runway for countries like China to reach internet saturation. Joe Barrato of Arrow Funds notes that technology that is needed in emerging markets originates there but migrates to developed markets, uses Uber, which began in Africa, as an example. Jay Pelosky of TPW Investment Management says China is setting up for a structural bull market, in his opinion. He also notes Latin America is the only region in the world where growth is supposed to be higher in 2019 than in 2018, and higher in 2020 than in 2019. David Garff of Accuvest says in Latin America, investors should watch for events like regime change when considering investment.\u00a03:00 Geraci asks how many people in the room currently use alternative strategies. About half the hands in the room go up. Geraci then asks Alistair Lowe, managing director and senior portfolio manager for quantitate beta strategies at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, how advisors should consider ETF due diligence. Lowe says you need to understand: 1) how strategies are diversified; 2) the strength and experience of the team behind them; and 3) where performance is coming from.2:50 First up in the \"How To Use Alternative ETF Strategies,\" moderator Nate Geraci of The ETF Store asks his panelists, \"What makes an alternative ETF?\" Nancy Davis, CIO of Quadratic Capital Management, says that alternatives are about versatility, about getting away from the exposures of a pure 60/40 stock/bond portfolio. \"I'd caution investors to make sure an alternative ETF really is something that is different, and not just the same old thing with a different label.\"\u00a010:55\u00a0Hougan suggests advisors can't compete with the likes of WealthFront and Schwab, and mass customization is the next multibillion-dollar opportunity for advisors. Nadig says the Great Unwrapping is inevitable: \"If you can't figure out how you fit in that world, we can guarantee you someone else will.\"10:50\u00a0Dave notes that mass customization is everywhere, and investors will be able to tweak portfolios according to what matters to them: who you work for, what sectors you're concentrated in as a family, etc.\u00a010:45\u00a0Most of the barriers to direct indexing are simply software problems, Nadig says. Hougan points out the firm of Just Invest as an exaample of a firm creating personalized indexes that allows investors to fine-tune their exposures, including ESG and tax-loss harvesting.\u00a010:40\u00a0Direct indexing has been around for a while, with Parametric's core strategy topping $100 billion. There is more money in Eaton Vance's Parametric unit than in the rest of Eaton Vance.\u00a010:35\u00a0Making two big changes to their charts. Nadig says peak ETFs was in 2017, and that ETF assets will outnumber mutual fund assets by 2024, instead of 2025. Hougan says funds are just a technology for delivering securities to you. ETFs are not the end of fund evolution after closed-end funds were supplanted by mutual funds were supplanted by ETFs. Nadig points out ETFs aren't perfect for everyone due to values, personal circumstances, structure restrictions, etc. Hougan mentions The Great Unwrapping that will rely on direct indexing, with a personal index for investors.\u00a0 \u00a010:30\u00a0Dave Nadig and Matt Hougan present the \"The State of the ETF Union 2019: The Dawn of Mass Personalization.\" According to Nadig, that state is \"really, really, really good.\" Mutual funds lost $92 billion since 2009, while ETFs gained $2.3 trillion, averaging more than $908 million in inflows every day. Hougan says if it's a good time to be an ETF issuer, it's even better to be an investor. His World's Cheapest ETF Portfolio is now down to 5 bps in cost.\u00a010:15\u00a0Wigglesworth asks, \"What will be 'the next thing' along the lines of bitcoin in 2018\"? Rory Tobin says the gap between how ESG is viewed in the U.S. and Europe is most striking to him, with U.S. investors wondering more about what they're giving up in an ESG strategy. Farmer agrees ESG is a major conversation, but also points out factors and options-based strategies.10:00\u00a0Farmer calls ETFs an \"elegant construct.\"\u00a09:45\u00a0 Advisors are now able to have better asset allocation models because of ETFs, and that is a benefit of the immense amount of choices they bring to the market. Advisors and fiduciaries can help their clients make those choices, says David Gedeon of Nasdaq Information Services. Vanguard's Comegys notes that the vast majority of assets are flowing into traditional cap-weghted ETFs and that ETFs fit perfectly into a good financial plan.\u00a0Why is fixed income a barren wasteland in the ETF space? Wigglesworth asks. Gedeon notes that active management still shows some outperformance in fixed income, but says it will take time. Rory Tobin points out that fixed income ETFs are fixed income in an equity wrapper, so there was a learning curve. Trading desks are becoming more integrated, he notes and liquidity for fixed income ETFs has greatly improved, with more evolution yet to come.9:35\u00a0In \"The Business Leaders\" panel, moderated by Robin Wigglesworth of the Financial Times, Sanjay Arya of Morningstar says that ETFs offer a much better alignment of costs with what the product delivers, whereas active mutual funds have failed to deliver on returns, have higher costs and are associated with various scandals. Jamie Farmer of S&P Dow Jones Indices says the growth of ETFs and index funds is underpinned by decades of research indicating active managers underperform, and adds that active management has become more difficult with changes in market structure and new regulations.\u00a0 \u00a09:25\u00a0In active fixed income, costs erode manager alpha entirely in intermediate government bonds and significantly in corporate bonds, Davis says, illustrated via bar graphs. Smart risk-taking is key in active management, as well as knowing when to step back. If you're considering active management, carefully examine how the manager intends to generate added returns, he says. \"Everyone feels like a genius during a bull market,\" Davis notes.9:20\u00a0Just because volatility is normal doesn't mean your clients are comfortable with it. Advisors can add 150 bps in value by coaching clients to stick with their plans, Davis says. With equities expected to deliver more muted returns for the next 10 years, now is the time to evaluate the role of bonds in your clients' portfolios. They provide ballast and returns. Cash is projected to become more valuable.9:15 Greg Davis, CIO of Vanguard, says in his keynote that one of the top question he gets is what's driving the volatility in the market, and also, how did we find ourselves near a bear market in the fourth quarter of 2018? He says the principles of good investing still hold, adding that the uncertainty in the markets enhances the value that advisors provide. Global growth projections growth in the U.S. will slow to 2%, to 1% in Europe and 6% in China. Vanguard says there is a 35% chance of recession in 2019 and above 40% in 2020. We are unlikely to see any steep rises in inflation during the year. Interest rates likely to go up in June in the U.S., but unlikely to rise in Japan or Europe.\u00a0\u00a0Sunday, Feb. 10, 20195:30 Edelman ends with a question from the audience about how long the planet can survive. \"I feel, you might as well be optimistic about this, because the alternative is ...\" He shrugs.5:25 \"Disruption destroys companies,\" says Edelman. Nothing new about this: The horse and buggy was killed by the Model T. So advisors must decide: Are they selling horse and buggies, or Model Ts? And are they selling Model T's in the era of space shuttles?At risk of disruption from these technology innovations, says Edelman, are: annuity marketers, disability insurers, long-term care insurers, auto insurance, the auto industry, the automobile crash economy, municipal bonds, colleges and universities, the energy sector, banks and brokerages, real estate... \"It's hard to tell when the dominoes stop falling.\"There are opportunities, however, says Edelman. By 2030, the world GDP will be $122 trillion\u2014and the U.S. will be the biggest beneficiary. Advisors need to position their clients' portfolios for the world that will be, not the world that their parents and grandparents lived in.5:20 Retirement was a 20th-century innovation: didn't exist in the 1800s, won't exist in the 2100s. The \"linear lifeline\" is dead, replaced by the \"cyclical lifeline,\" where you go to school, get a job, go back to school to get retrained, then get a new job, ad infinitum. Financial goals will change as a result of this cycle. \"It's all about lifelong learning,\" says Edelman.However, by 2035, 47% of current jobs won't exist, due to technology. So clients are going to want to work longer, but technology will wipe out the jobs. Edelman says that today, \"college planning\" is the No. 1 focus in his practice; but it won't be an issue in the future, because in the future, college will be free or paid for by employers. As a result, financial advisors need to think about their clients' \"career planning,\" not \"college planning.\"5:15 \"We have to recognize radical changes in almost every aspect of life on the planet,\" says Edelman. He's talking about nanotech, sequencing the human genome, CRISPR technology, vastly higher human longevity and eradication of common diseases like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, addiction, all by the year 2030. Why? \"Because it has huge implications for personal finance,\" says Edelman. \"If your clients live to be 120, will their money last?\"5:00 Ric Edelman, founder and chairman of Edelman Financial Engines, starts off his keynote \"Building A Planning Practice For The 21st Century\" by saying we're in a transformational moment in time, where advisors must change how they run their practices. \"What got you here is not what will get you there.\" That's why branding and marketing is so important, says Edelman. He puts up some stats, including: Only 10% of advisors have a marketing plan, 93% of advisors won't be able to sell their practices, and that in the next five years, half of advisors will be gone. You can hear a pin drop in the room.4:50 U.S. ETF issuers looking to expand overseas should come to Europe first, then go over to Hong Kong, says Brian Higgins, partner of asset management and investment funds for Dillon Eustace. Roberts adds that \"the domicile of the fund doesn't really matter\"; that in Asia, they just want investors to have ETF options.4:45 In \"Global ETF Expansion: Successful Strategies For Launching Across Europe & Asia,\" moderator Malik Sarwar, CEO of K2 Leaders, asks Brian Roberts, senior vice president and head of ETPs for the Hong Kong Exchange, about the ETF opportunities in Asia. \"I think the next frontier for ETFs is Asia,\" says Roberts. Currently, Asia is largely an institutional market for ETFs, but it remains tiny. \"The train's still in the station; we're just boarding people.\"Asian ETF adoption will follow the same pattern as the U.S. market did: It'll start in the institutions, then trickle down into retail channels. But Asia is an opportunity that \"as an issuer, everybody should be salivating about.\" European issuers, says Roberts, are likely best to handle the challenge, because they deal with fragmentation on a daily basis, and the Asian market is very fragmented, lacking a common currency and standards.\u00a04:30 Question from the audience, \"Have earnings peaked yet?\" Handle says this is a question he gets all the time. He turns to manufacturing data; historically, earnings growth tends to lag manufacturing growth by six months. By this indicator, he says, it looks like earnings growth is about to slow down.Robust earnings in 2018 were likely due to the corporate tax reform, but even without that, you still had the best earnings growth since 2011. So, Handle's answer is: Maybe: \"25% earnings growth will be tough to beat,\" he added; even if earnings have peaked, \"it doesn't necessarily mean the end of the cycle.\" Also, he's not particularly concerned about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.4:15 In \"Anatomy Of A Recession: Recognizing & Preparing For Risk,\" portfolio specialist and VP Corey Handle of ClearBridge Investments gives his 12 indicators that historically have signaled an impending recession. The overall theme is \"You can't look at any of these in insolation.\"First indicator? The yield-curve spread. Yield-curve inversion is \"very misunderstood\" by investors. \"Where people go wrong is they see this as the final buzzer before the end of a basketball game,\" said Handle. Instead, investors should think of it as a \"shot clock.\"3:30\u00a0Michael Cronan says explainer videos are great content to drive marketing for complex funds in particular, to put the explanation in a video and tie all the marketing content to it.Summing up: Edward Baer advises newcomers to the industry to come to Inside ETFs. Charles Ragauss says it's important to get the right people and find the right partners. Michael Cronan says having a unique product you believe in is key. Stacy Fuller advises \"hire a good lawyer.\"3:15 What should an RIA be prepared to spend? Going your own route is more expensive, but gives the RIA more power, while the white-label route involves ceding some power and day-to-day control to another firm. Fuller disputes that it must be more expensive to go your own way. Michael Cronan mentions that many newcomers don't include marketing as a separate upfront cost. White label allows firms to outsource the marketing and PR, he says. Fuller notes that white label has gone through some evolution wherein white labels now give clients more control and allow them to take successful funds with them. Cronan says his firm has spun off several funds.\u00a03:00 Charles Ragauss notes that it can take three to five years for a fund to find firm footing, but it's not the \"end-all, be-all.\" Chris Sullivan asks if there is a \"BYOA\" (bring your own assets) blueprint. Stacy Fuller says it can be through firms bringing their own following; in other words, firms favored by institutions, or by leveraging existing platforms. Charles Ragauss says smaller firms can leverage their thought leadership.\u00a02:50 Mike Cronan says it's important to have a lead salesperson to be the public face of the fund. Stacy Fuller responds to Chris Sullivan's question about why more mutual funds don't get repackaged as ETFs, noting that active managers don't really want to share their \"secret sauce,\" but adds that we may see such products more after the implementation of the ETF rule.\u00a02:40\u00a0\"So You Want To Launch An ETF?\", moderated by MacMillan Communications' Chris Sullivan, kicked off with a discussion of the ETF rule, with Edward Baer of Ropes & Gray and Stacey Fuller of K&L Gates discussing the importance of lining up investors and assets as early as possible. Charles Ragnauss of Exponential ETFs notes the ETF rule doesn't nullify the importance of white-label firms, which have the relationships, experience and procedural/legal knowledge of the ETF space necessary for a successful launch. Baer points out the importance of having a person with capital markets expertise for a launch.2:35\u00a0Melissa Gainor says comments indicated a lot of general agreement on the need and parameters for an ETF rule.\u00a02:30 The proposed interactive calculator would allow an investor to customize the bid/ask spread for their situation. Jane Heinrichs notes there wasn't a lot of support among issuers for such a calculator. Michael Mundt proposes the SEC maintain such a calculator on its own website for purposes of standardization.2:25\u00a0ETFs with basket flexibility\u2014as in they were allowed to rely on custom baskets\u2014saw reduced costs for investors and weathered periods of market stress significantly better, according to Jane Heinrichs of the Investment Company Institute.Melissa Gainor highlights a new Q&A section that explains the impact of trading costs in ETF prospectuses. The questions address bid/ask spread concerns on a $10,000 investment. Michael Mundt of Stradley Ronon notes that issuers objected, in particular, to the level of specificity requiring a median bid/ask spread as it could add significant costs to get the necessary data.\u00a02:15\u00a0In the session titled \"The ETF Rule,\" Melissa Gainor of the SEC's Division of Investment Management notes that many commenters were opposed to the proposal that portfolio holdings be required to be disclosed before market open, as they believed it would interfere with T-1 settlement. The SEC is considering those objections.\u00a0"

  "topic": "ETF Of The Week: Gaming Fund Still Buoyant",
  "parag": "This week was a tough one for video gaming stocks. Stock prices for several major publishers and developers tanked, after the firms reported disappointing quarterly earnings and expressed grave concerns about their future.Electronic Arts (EA) dropped 15% on Wednesday after missing revenue targets and cutting its annual outlook, while Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) fell 13% after revising its next-quarter forecast to a lower-than-expected level.EA blamed \"intense competition\" in the space, especially from the free-to-play category of games, including the smash-hit multiplayer shooter, \u201cFortnite.\u201d Meanwhile, Take Two hit its earnings targets, but also admitted it had plans to pursue a \u201cFortnite\u201d competitor.\u00a0The companies' financial troubles also dragged other video game stocks lower. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) fell 10% Wednesday (even though it doesn't report earnings until next week). Ubisoft and Nintendo also fell.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Those financial troubles also impacted the $96 million ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (GAMR), the largest video game stock ETF. Since Wednesday, GAMR has fallen 3.4%. Year-to-date, however, GAMR remains up 7.9%:\u00a0Source: StockCharts.com; data as of Feb. 7, 2019\u00a0Diversified PortfolioGAMR has remained relatively buoyant in the face of such a disappointing earnings season because its portfolio is broader than just video game publishers and developers.The fund holds a portfolio of 80 stocks broken into various buckets: \"pure play\" hardware and software developers, \"nonpure play\" supporting firms and \"conglomerates,\" whose business extends beyond just the video game business. As such, GAMR holds a range of toy companies, internet services and software companies, in addition to its hardware and electronics firms.Furthermore, only 27% of its holdings are in U.S. companies, mitigating the impact any single American publisher will have on the overall portfolio. Meanwhile, 25% of the holdings are from gaming heavyweight Japan, and another 18% from Korea.Competition From VanEckFor years, GAMR was the only video game ETF on the market. In October, however, the $9 million VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO) launched, with an emphasis on eSports companies.Even though ESPO is 0.20% cheaper than GAMR, carrying a 0.55% expense ratio, it has yet to draw many assets, possibly because a video game ETF\u2014like many thematic investments\u2014tends to be a high-conviction play, with investors willing to stick out periods of bad performance.Neither fund is particularly liquid or well-traded, and considering how liquid the underlying stocks are, both funds carry fairly wide spreads (ESPO's is 0.13%, while GAMR's is 0.22%). Interested investors should tread with care.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "Competition Heats Up For Marijuana ETFs",
  "parag": "On Tuesday, Feb. 5, the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ), the market's sole pure-play marijuana fund, crossed $1 billion in assets under management. The fund's assets now stand at $1.02 billion, making MJ the world's largest marijuana ETF.It's vindication, perhaps, for an ETF that has seen a rocky 14 months, from the unorthodox way in which it came to launch to the sudden parting of ways with its former custodian. MJ has also suffered persistently high trading spreads and bouts of large premiums/discounts to NAV.Yet the ETF's asset base just keeps growing, likely due to its rock-star performance over the past several months. Year-to-date, MJ is up 47%, while on a 12-month basis, the fund is up 23%.\u00a0Source: StockCharts.com. Data as of Feb. 6, 2019.\u00a0Potential Competitors FileFor now, MJ remains the only pure-play marijuana ETF in the U.S. However, in recent weeks, several potential competitors have filed for their own such funds.\u00a0 \u00a0In late November 2018, Innovation Shares filed for a marijuana ETF that would use a broker-dealer instead of a bank to custody its marijuana stocks, thus potentially resolving the custodial reticence that has up to this point prevented many issuers from launching their own funds (read: \"New Wrinkle To Marijuana ETFs\").Then on Jan. 28, AdvisorShares filed for the AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF, an actively managed fund that would trade under the proposed ticker \u201cYOLO\u201d and track a wide range of companies directly and indirectly connected to cannabis and hemp cultivation, research, production and sale.\u00a0 \u00a0Just a few days later, on Feb. 5, Amplify ETFs filed for the Amplify Seymour Alternative Plant Economy ETF, a resubmitted version of a previous filing for a fund with a different investment objective. Amplify's fund would cover much of the same ground as the AdvisorShares fund, but it would be actively managed by one of the world's foremost cannabis investing experts.Thorny Legal IssueAll three fund proposals are careful to point out the legality of the stocks in which they're investing.Innovation Shares explicitly states it will only invest in \"legal cannabis industry\" companies, while AdvisorShares requires its holdings to be registered with the Drug Enforcement Agency or other relevant federal agencies.Amplify's prospectus even goes so far as to say that it won't hold U.S.-based growers or distributors of marijuana or even \"medical marijuana\" companies, drawing a distinction between these and pharmaceutical companies that derive drugs based on the compounds within the cannabis leaf.The emphasis on legality is key, as it strikes to the heart of why many big U.S. banks so far have declined to serve as custodians for marijuana ETFs. Custodying stocks involved with a drug still outlawed by the U.S government could potentially run a bank afoul of federal banking laws.That's true even if marijuana is fully legal in the country in which the stocks are domiciled. Although those stocks may fall outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Justice, the custodian bank holding them does not. (read: \"Promise & Peril Of Marijuana ETFs\").However, in 2018, the marijuana industry hit what many consider a tipping point toward legalization in the U.S., or at least laxer oversight. As of last year's elections, more than 30 U.S. states have legalized the medical usage of marijuana, while 10 have legalized its full recreational usage as well.Furthermore, Attorney General nominee William Barr has testified that he would respect local and state marijuana laws, stating that he has no intention of using federal resources to \"go after\" companies complying with state law.This represents a change in direction for the Department of Justice, which had been renewing its efforts to prosecute federal marijuana crimes under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u00a0Good Time To File?The political environment may be good for marijuana ETFs in more ways than one, given the recent government shutdown (and the potential one looming on the horizon).All three of the proposed marijuana ETFs would be launched from existing trusts\u2014a technical point of procedure that may impact their likelihood of coming to launch.When an existing ETF issuer, one that has already secured exemptive relief and the approval to establish a trust from the SEC, wants to launch new funds, it usually does so by filing for a \"post-effective amendment\" to the trust. Barring SEC comment, the funds proposed in these post-effective amendments often become automatically effective after some waiting period, usually 60 or 75 days.However, given that the government shutdown has generated a tremendous backlog for the agency, it is unclear how likely if or when that SEC comment would come\u2014not just for marijuana ETFs, but for all proposed funds (read: \"SEC Shutdown's Impact On ETFs\").That's not to suggest issuers are attempting to skirt SEC scrutiny; after all, both AdvisorShares and Amplify could have filed their funds during the shutdown, but chose not to. (Innovation Shares filed before the shutdown began.)However, with the SEC so overtasked, and with less pressure from a Justice Department eager to persecute marijuana-related crimes, this may in fact be the perfect moment to bring these more controversial funds to launch. Only time will tell.Similarities Among FilingsBoth the AdvisorShares and Amplify proposals would be actively managed, while the Innovation Shares proposal would be indexed. None of the three proposals has yet specified an expense ratio.What's more, none of the three ETFs have yet named a custodian, transfer agent, accounting agent or fund administrator. Whether or not the firms would use the same service providers listed for other funds within the same trust is unclear.The Innovation Shares fund would track U.S. and Canadian companies involved in the cannabis, hemp and cannabidiol industries, including pharmaceutical firms, consumer wellness and product markets.Meanwhile, the AdvisorShares fund would invest in companies that derive at least half their net revenue from the marijuana and hemp industries, or firms registered with the DEA to conduct cannabis-related medical product research and development. Intriguingly, AdvisorShares also reserves the right to invest in initial public offerings, in addition to the usual menu of equities and derivatives.Finally, the Amplify fund would track companies engaged in three different sectors of the global cannabis/hemp ecosystem: industries based on the cultivation, sale and production of the cannabis/hemp plant; supporting industries such as agricultural technology or real estate; and ancillary industries such as consumption devices.The fund would be managed by Tim Seymour, head of Seymour Asset Management and host of CNBC\u2019s Fast Money.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

As we like to say, it\u2019s the annual gathering of the who\u2019s who of the ETF industry\u2014a highlight of the year.There\u2019s something for everyone on the agenda this year.Sunday kicks off with two major tracks, one focused on the basics and mechanics of ETF investing, the other focused on the business of running ETFs\u2014including regulation, global ETF expansion and the challenges of a business where fee compression is the norm. It\u2019s a day that has become known for its hands-on learning opportunities, and an advisor-favorite platform to exchange ideas.Our own Dave Nadig will help get things going on Monday with his broad view of the state of the ETF industry, and where ETF investing is headed. It\u2019s a can\u2019t-miss, if we may say so.Key Speakers & TopicsOther keynote speakers of note include Vanguard\u2019s Greg Davis, who will offer his big-picture of the ETF market and the pockets where value opportunities lie; Ric Edelman, who will share his expertise on the business of ETFs, and author Michael Lewis, known for his best-selling books \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker,\u201d \u201cMoneyball\u201d and the \u201cThe Blind Side.Throughout the conference, there\u2019ll be many breakout sessions covering all the latest trends in ETF investing, from thematic approaches to income-seeking to active management to bitcoin. ETF strategists will also be sharing their macro views of the markets, and their ETF picks for this year.As an industry, in 2018, we saw 267 new ETFs come to market, making it the second-most-prolific year yet for ETF issuers. On the opposite side, ETF closures hit a record of 157 funds\u2014a testament to the fact that the ETF market is innovating but maturing.With more than 2,200 ETFs listed in the U.S. today, growing U.S. and global demand for the ETF wrapper, and product innovation full-steam ahead, there\u2019s plenty to talk about at this year\u2019s conference.

  "topic": "Why January Gold Rallies Don\u2019t Last",
  "parag": "There\u2019s something about January that brings the gold bulls out. In the past five years, the yellow metal has risen at least 3.3% during January. In 2019, it rose 3.5% in the first month.January\u2019s winning ways for gold extend even further back than that. Of the past 20 years, 14 have had Januarys in which gold ended higher.It certainly seems that gold buyers like to make their moves when the New Year rolls around, and this year is no different. Physical gold ETFs are seeing solid inflows this year, including $1 billion for the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), $639 million for the iShares Gold Trust (IAU), $187 million for the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (GLDM) and $133 million for the GraniteShares Gold Trust (BAR).The amount of gold now held by ETFs, 73 million troy ounces, is at the highest level since 2013, according to Bloomberg data. That\u2019s a 60% rise from the recent low point for holdings in 2015, but still below the all-time high of 82.7 million in 2012.\u00a0Total Gold ETF Holdings\u00a0Hedging Their BetsThere are myriad potential explanations for the sudden interest in gold. Slowing global growth, a dovish Fed, lower interest rates and financial market volatility are all plausible reasons investors are buying now.Indeed, December was a rough and scary period for investors, as the S&P 500 flirted with a bear market, and uncertainty about trade and Fed policy weighed on the economic outlook. Stocks may have bounced back sharply in the past month, but with December still fresh in their minds, investors are hedging their bets by diversifying into gold.Central Bank Buying FrenzyWhat\u2019s more, investors aren\u2019t the only ones diversifying. Central banks have been some of the biggest buyers of gold recently, accounting for nearly one-sixth of global gold demand.According to the World Gold Council, central banks purchased nearly 21 million troy ounces of gold last year, up 74% from the year before and the second-highest annual total ever.The primary buyers were Russia\u2014which completely sold its U.S. Treasury holdings to fund its purchases\u2014as well as Turkey, Kazakhstan, Hungary, Poland and India.\u201cHeightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty throughout the year increasingly drove central banks to diversify their reserves and refocus their attention on the principal objective of investing in safe and liquid assets,\u201d said the World Gold Council, which also noted that total gold demand increased by 4% in 2018, putting it close to the five-year average level.Elusive Breakout With ETF investors and central banks simultaneously buying gold, it\u2019s no wonder the yellow metal has been rallying. But that doesn\u2019t mean the price gains will continue.There has yet to be a true breakout for the yellow metal. Demand has risen, but not enough to move the needle on prices, especially as supply has crept up too.As gold demand flatlined for the past five years, so too have gold prices. In fact, five years ago today, prices for the metal were trading at nearly the same level as they are now, close to $1,300. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing; gold has held its value, which is the only thing some investors want.\u00a0Spot Gold PriceGraphs source: Bloomberg\u00a0Others who are looking for a bigger move in prices may have to wait longer. Eventually, gold may break out\u20142019 could even be the year\u2014but something has to fundamentally change before investors are willing to pay significantly higher prices for the yellow metal.Until then, January spikes in gold are likely to be short-lived.Email Sumit Roy at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or follow him on Twitter\u00a0sumitroy2"

  "topic": "Rating ETFs & Staying Diversified",
  "parag": "Mary Ann Bartels has held many key roles at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and currently she is head of ETF strategy and the firm\u2019s Research Investment committee (RIC). She is, among other things, spearheading the bank\u2019s ETF research and ratings efforts, while keeping a close eye on the economy. Bartels will be speaking at Inside ETFs, Feb. 10-13, in Hollywood, Florida.\u00a0ETF.com: What\u2019s unique about BofA\u2019s new coverage and ratings of ETFs? Mary Ann Bartels: In October, we launched coverage on ETFs. The industry had not been able to have an opinion on ETFs based on the SEC ruling that ETFs were classified as IPOs because of the creation/redemption process. But legislation passed in Congress called the FAIR Act that now allows Wall Street to have opinions on ETFs.So as a financial institution, we now have ratings on ETFs. If you\u2019re a client of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, you have access to the research and financial advisors also have access to the research. What\u2019s unique is that we now have opinions on ETFs, and this is the first time Wall Street can actually have an opinion. Before, you could only talk about factual information on ETFs.We have a very large research department with industry analysts that cover a broad spectrum of companies, so we've decided to look at ETFs as portfolios\u2014it\u2019s not just about an index anymore.We have a systematic process that's made of three different components: E stands for efficiency. T stands for technical. F stands for fundamental.Efficiency is generally all the factors the industry's been using for years\u2014tracking, NAV, bid/ask spread, liquidity. It's really \u201cE\u201d that the industry has been looking at. \u201cT,\u201d the technicals, is important because price momentum is important. Our analyst has a proprietary 12-month price momentum indicator that we use.And F, \u201cfundamental,\u201d is probably one of the most unique components, where we look at the stock level and at our analyst ratings on the stocks. We take those three components, compile them in a proprietary ranking system, and score ETFs within what we call peer groupings. We don\u2019t look at ETFs in a silo, we compare them to similar ETFs.ETF.com: Have you found that your ratings don\u2019t always recommend the biggest, most liquid and most well-known ETFs? They aren\u2019t always the best? Bartels: Absolutely. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is the most liquid equity in the world. It's the deepest and it has options on it. That's the default; if I want to own the S&P 500, I go to SPY.But when you compare SPY to the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), efficiency really becomes the factor you look at, because they're identical.Fundamentals and technicals are really not going to apply here, so the \u201cE\u201d is what you focus on. And when you look at the \u201cE,\u201d IVV and VOO track the S&P 500 better, and, they're cheaper.There are times you want to pay a higher fee. If there's a certain portfolio of stocks you want to own, that fit your investment goals and profile, it's worth paying the extra fee on that ETF. But you have to look at the whole picture.ETF.com: How often do the ETF ratings change? Is this a constant exercise?Bartels: We run our models every day. Since we launched in October, we've had over 20 ETF rating changes.ETF.com: When you\u2019re researching and rating ETFs, does the macroeconomic picture enter that analysis? Bartels: When it comes to the ETF work, no, we don't input that. That will get indirectly put into the ETFs through our analyst's weighting. The assumption is that the analyst is taking in all fundamental accounts coming up to their earnings number.Now, I wear two different hats at the firm. I also run our RIC product. And in that, I closely watch macro events.ETF.com: That\u2019s the hat you're going to be wearing on the Inside ETFs panel you're scheduled to speak on?Bartels: Correct, I'll have my RIC hat on.ETF.com: We're hearing a lot about a slowdown in corporate earnings. What's your view on the U.S. equity space right now?Bartels: Markets have cycles. They have up cycles, they have down cycles. We do our year-ahead in late November, early December, and what we wrote back then is we expected corporate earnings to slow down dramatically to around 5%.This is within our forecast, and we're not surprised. All the benefits from the tax cut are pretty much priced in. We've seen global economies slow down. And we're even forecasting that our own economy\u2014which grew above trend for two years\u2014will slow down and still grow, but slow at trend. Typically, when you have slower economic projections, that can translate into slower earnings.We're already there. We're not calling for an earnings recession. We're not calling for negative earnings. We were calling for a \u201cbaby bear\u201d market. We didn't expect it to happen in the month of December, but it did. We're still expecting volatility to remain.But we do believe we remain in a secular bull market. Even though this has been a cyclical correction, it's been a bear cyclical correction. But we think the longer-term secular uptrend is up, so we're buyers of the market.ETF.com: What pockets do you particularly like? Bartels: Where we see leadership is in technology and health care. We think if you get a China deal, the sector that's best positioned to benefit from it will be industrials. For income, with yields now coming back down and the Fed becoming a little bit more dovish, we think utilities would be a place you can go back to.ETF.com: What about the international landscape? Are you buyers there too? Bartels: We\u2019re in the camp of being more selective. We acknowledge emerging markets are the most attractive because valuation is there. But we haven't moved to an overweight. Europe and Japan would not be our top pick. We would be United States, emerging markets and tied between Europe and Japan.Remember that we have Brexit. Some of our macro analysts in Europe are concerned about the economy in Europe slowing down. We do have a slight pickup in Japan.ETF.com: Is this a good time to be more tactical with all that\u2019s going on globally? Bartels: If you take a longer-term view, you don't have to go tactical. Tactical is for traders, whereas strategic positioning is for clients, particularly in wealth management.And when it comes to a wealth management client, it's about the asset allocation. That explains the returns over the longer term. Make sure you have an asset allocation that meets not only your goals, but your risk tolerance.And what we learned with the baby bear market is diversification\u2014that\u2019s what cushions a portfolio. We tend to forget about that when markets go up, because the portfolio's going up, so we don't question it.When we start seeing volatility, we encourage our clients to really look at their asset allocation and their risk profile, and to rebalance if they're not positioned where they should be. Rebalancing means you take some profits from something that\u2019s done well, like equities, and go back to your asset allocation weighting. Not enough clients look to rebalance, because it's working, so they don't want to touch it. You have to do some tactical rebalancing from time to time.But I always encourage clients that, as long as you're not a trader, don't pay attention to the day-to-day noise of the markets, because it increases the likelihood you're going to make a mistake in your portfolio.ETF.com: Is diversification harder to come by today due to higher correlations between equity and fixed income? Do you have to get creative? Bartels: I don't buy into that at all. Yes, correlations have gone up, so you could see stocks and bonds being down. But bonds are down less than stocks, so you're still diversified. Diversification can involve a negative number. It\u2019s not ideal, and I think when people think of diversification, they think of positive returns. It's not always about a positive return. It's about having a different return. It's the difference in the type of volatility in the returns.Cash was a great diversifier, and cash has done nothing in portfolios for a long time. But now, cash actually has a return; it's an asset again, it's not giving you zero. But cash was always an asset in the sense that, if markets went down, it didn't go down. People underestimate the power of cash. You don't have to go into exotic volatility products to get diversification.Contact Cinthia Murphy at [email\u00a0protected]"

ETF.com recently sat down with him to discuss how he uses\u2014or doesn't use\u2014ETFs at his firm.\u00a0ETF.com: About how much of your assets under management are in ETFs?Garth Friesen: Actually, it's a very low percentage\u2014less than 1%. We primarily use them for fixed income and credit derivatives. Usually, we use over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, interest rate swaps, interest rate \"swaptions.\" We use other credit derivatives as well.

From a capital efficiency standpoint, sometimes we're better off in OTC derivatives than in ETFs.ETF.com: When you do decide to use ETFs, what makes you reach for them over other instruments?Friesen: We tend to use ETFs opportunistically, where the ETF\u2014whether it's the ETF's liquidity or more nuanced exposure\u2014offers something we can't get in the more leveraged vehicles.Every once in a while, we'll have a trade that flags the ETFs\u2014whether it's the duration of the trade, how long we plan to hold, whether it's a gamma trade with an option where we'll actively delta-hedge it, and so on.Most of the time, when we operate the ETFs, it's on the credit side, like with HYG [the iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF]. Every once in a while, we'll use LQD [the iShares iBoxx USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF].But wherever there's liquidity, we'll often deal in options even more than the underlying. Sometimes the option on the ETF is a better opportunity than the others that are available.ETF.com: Do you find you end up using options on ETFs more than the ETFs themselves?Friesen: Yes, though that's more unique to us than the industry. We'll use the ETF if we're trying to do some sort of relative value trade. But given the frequency and flows we generate when we come into the market, we're probably more on the options side than we are the ETF side.ETF.com: Why do you prefer options instead of the actual underlying funds?Friesen: One reason is that there's a total return swap market out there that replicates, for example, the exposure of HYG, but we'll only need to post maybe 1-2% margin, instead of 50% or whatever you'd need if you were dealing in the ETF itself. That's so much more capital efficient. And so there's no real capital disadvantage to using ETF options, whereas sometimes there is when using an ETF, compared to other institutional alternatives like swap lines.Of course, for somebody who doesn't have swap lines, and who can't do OTC derivatives, they don't have any other alternative. But an institutional player who has swap lines at their disposal can sometimes get better capital treatment in the OTC market than the ETF market.Yes, the total cost of trading an ETF is a lot better than in the underlying cash market, particularly in fixed-income sectors like munis [municipal bonds] and corporate bonds. If your only alternative is cash or ETFs, then ETFs show up as the superior product from liquidity, transaction costs, execution and time to execute.But if you have the ability to trade OTC derivatives, ETFs can be costlier in terms of not being able to get as much leverage, even if they're lower-cost in terms of bid/ask spreads and the ability to execute electronically.ETF.com: You'll be speaking at Inside ETFs, on \"The Hedge Fund Approach: The Smart Money in ETFs\" panel. Would you give our readers some insight into what you plan to discuss in the session?Friesen: A lot of the panel has an institutional background, so we'll focus on actionable trade ideas using ETFs, or at least using ETFs for a portion of the strategy.\u00a0ETF.com: But didn't you just tell me that you don't really use ETFs all that much at your hedge fund?Friesen: [laughs] Well, I'm going to talk about how somebody could use ETFs to do what we do, somebody who doesn't necessarily have the constraints we have. The plan is to translate some of our ideas and show how they could be implemented in ETF form.ETF.com: Fair enough. Anything you can highlight as a sneak peek?Friesen: I imagine that of the main themes that'll be discussed might be the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the course of the next 12 months, if that takes place as the Fed goes on hold. So, if that's your highest-conviction idea, what ways could you play that as alternatives to owning the broader market?That could mean moving down to the sector level and into ETFs that have higher correlation with the U.S. dollar. Or if you have the view that a lower U.S. dollar will coincide with stable-to-lower interest rates, then maybe [you look at] the more interest-rate-sensitive ETFs that benefit from a lower rate/ weaker dollar environment.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "ETF Of The Week: Oil's Fall Lifts Refiners Fund",
  "parag": "With oil prices dropping, it's a good time to be invested in refiners.Over the past month, oil and gas equipment and services ETFs have made up three of the five top-performing funds (the InfraCap MLP ETF (AMZA) deals with energy master limited partnerships, a related segment):\u00a0Sources: ETF.com, FactSet; data as of Jan. 31, 2019\u00a0In fact, energy services ETFs are vastly outperforming energy ETFs, which have struggled over the past month given the backslide in crude oil prices over the same time period.Of all the oil services ETFs burning up our charts, the best-performing is the $210 million SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF (XES), which is up 20.6% over a one-month period. That's why we've made it our pick for ETF of the Week.\u00a0Source: StockCharts.com; data as of Jan. 31, 2019\u00a0Refiners, Pipelines Benefit When Crude SlidesOver most of 2018, oil rebounded considerably from the previous year, hitting the $70s/barrel by summer. But by December, oil prices had once again begun to fall, as rising U.S. stockpiles and falling economic sentiment helped depress demand.It may seem counterintuitive, but refiners and other services companies actually benefit from falling oil prices. Refiners have to purchase crude to supply their factories, so lower oil prices mean higher margins for them.Meanwhile, pipeline companies benefit from the volume of oil that passes through their infrastructure; lower oil prices more crude oil flows.Furthermore, equipment sellers can benefit from a slide in oil prices, as wildcatters often take that opportunity to pause their exploratory activities to upgrade equipment and better position themselves for a pricing rebound.XES tracks oil and gas equipment and services companies. Just over half (53%) of its holdings are in oil-related services and equipment companies, while another quarter are in drilling hardware and services. The top three stocks in XES are Weatherford International (WFT) (4%), McDermott International (MDR) (4%) and Rowan Cos Plc (RDC) (3%).XES' Secret Sauce: Equal WeightingEqual-weighted XES carries a small-cap tilt that sets it apart from its competition. Whereas XES' main competitors, the $1.1 billion VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH) and the $182 million iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services ETF (IEZ), allocate roughly 20% of their portfolios to the drilling heavyweight Schlumberger (SLB), XES gives the firm just a 3% weight.Overall, XES' portfolio has a weighted average market cap of $4.9 billion, compared with OIH's $18 billion average market cap. XES also has more names in its portfolio than OIH (36 holdings to OIH's 23), resulting in a more diverse take in a field of relatively top-heavy products.\u00a0With an expense ratio of 0.35%, XES costs the same as OIH, the segment's heavyweight. It is also fairly liquid, with strong average volume ($19 million traded daily) and relatively tight spreads of 0.10%.Contact Lara Crigger at [email\u00a0protected]"

  "topic": "Jack Bogle Led This Investing Fee War",
  "parag": "[Editor\u2019s Note: The following originally appeared on FactSet.com. Elisabeth Kashner is director of ETF research and analytics for FactSet.]\u00a0Jack Bogle, Vanguard founder and the father of low-cost index investing, famously declared, \u201cIn investing, you get what you don\u2019t pay for.\u201d Bogle championed low cost and simplicity, endearing him to investors and revolutionizing the asset management industry.Since his passing\u00a0this month\u00a0at the age of 89, he has been widely celebrated for his contributions to the investment industry.However, the finest celebration of Jack\u2019s life work can be found in the increased size of investor returns, reflected in the historical decrease in investment management fees paid. Investors have been paying silent tribute to Jack Bogle for years, by flocking to cheap, broad-based, simple index funds.We can celebrate Jack Bogle\u2019s life by the numbers, by measuring the decline in investment fees and the rise of Vanguard-style investing across the ETF industry. 2018 was a banner year for the trends Jack Bogle set in motion.2018 showed that, once again, low cost and high efficiency are winning investors\u2019 hearts, minds, and wallets, while expensive, inefficient products are losing out. Winners are cheap ETFs, while losers include active mutual funds, many hedge funds, and even expensive ETFs.Asset managers continue to slash expense ratios, while investors pile into low-cost funds and shun expensive ones.Race To ZeroFee compression, also known as \u201cthe fee war,\u201d continued at a rapid pace in 2018. ETF issuers continue to cut fees as clients seek ever-cheaper options. Fidelity\u2019s 0.00% fee mutual funds grabbed headlines\u2014and some $2.6 billion in assets\u2014by winning the race to zero.The ETF price tag keeps falling. What was cheap in 2017 looked a bit rich in 2018, as the threshold for attractive pricing continued to drop. As investors rewarded low expense ratios, asset managers played catchup by cutting fees.FactSet documented 283 fee cuts among U.S.-domiciled ETFs, excluding geared funds. That\u2019s 13.5% of the universe, by count. While many cuts were minor, some were quite dramatic, as depicted in the chart below.\u00a0\u00a0Cheap Thrashes ExpensiveInvestors rewarded cheapness and punished high-cost funds. The iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA) was 2018\u2019s No. 1 ETF by inflows. Its cannibalization of its higher-priced sister fund, the iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), provides a perfect example of the ETF price war in action.In 2018, 77 U.S.-domiciled funds competed in the developed ex-U.S. equity total market segment. Four funds dominated the segment, with 81% of segment assets at the start of 2018. Three of the four are competitively priced, at 0.06% to 0.08%. Still, at the beginning of 2018, EFA dominated the segment, despite its annual cost of 0.31%. That domination ended in 2018.IEFA, the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA), and the Schwab International Equity ETF (SCHF) toppled EFA, taking in $34.68 billion, while EFA suffered $10.63 billion in net redemptions.\u00a0\u00a02018 Market Share Changes & Expense Ratios, Top 4 Developed-Market Ex-US ETFs\n\u00a0With a 0.31% expense ratio, EFA can no longer compete with rivals charging 0.06%, 0.07% or 0.08%.Market Share Shifts Reflect Lower Cost ETFsThis same story played out in segment after segment, asset class after asset class, across all investment strategies. Dollars flowed to cheap funds, while expensive ones lost out. This resulted in a shift in market share from costly funds to cheap ones.The stakes got higher\u2014actually, lower\u2014this year. On an asset-weighted basis, the bar for cheapness dropped during the course of 2018. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the alternatives asset class.Back in 2017, alternatives ETFs that gained market share cost an asset-weighted average of 0.86%, while the losers cost 0.92%. Over 2018, investors flocked to alternatives funds costing, on average, 0.79%; market share losers\u2019 expense ratios averaged 0.86%. Price tags that attracted assets in 2017 became undesirable in 2018.The fee war hit the bread-and-butter asset classes just as hard. Equity ETF market share winners\u2019 price tags fell to an average of 0.16% in 2018, down 0.01% from 2017. Equity ETF market share losers\u2019 costs dropped 0.01%, as well, to 0.23%. An equity fund with a 0.20% price tag could be considered midrange in 2017, but was more on the edge in 2018.The table below illustrates how the fee war played out across asset classes in 2018.\u00a0\u00a0Asset-Weighted Expense Ratios For Funds That Gained/Lost Market Share, By Asset Class & Year\u00a0In the largest segments\u2014those with assets of $100 billion or more\u2014the price war was fiercer still, with market share winners costing 0.11% and losers 0.19%, on an asset-weighted average basis. Funds that closed up shop for good cost 0.33%.That bears repeating. In a space where actively managed mutual funds routinely charged 1.00% or 1.25% a decade ago, ETFs that charge 0.20% are now uncompetitive.A More Expensive Mousetrap?Not long ago, in 2014 and 2015, ETF issuers, having written off \u201ccheap beta\u201d as unprofitable, expected to maintain pricing power by offering complex strategies that were \u201csmarter\u201d than the vanilla funds. They turned out to be half right.While the complex strategies have caught on with some investors and do carry higher expense ratios, the price war is as active among complex funds as it is among the simple ones.Two examples\u2014one set of value funds, and one set of money market substitutes\u2014will make the point.In 2018, the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) overtook the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) as the largest U.S. value ETF thanks to its $8.5 billion of inflows in 2018. VTV\u2019s price tag is now 0.05%, down from 0.06% in 2017. IWD costs 0.20% per year. That\u2019s no longer an attractive price point.Similarly, the cash equivalent segment saw J.P. Morgan displace its long-established, twice-as-expensive PIMCO competitor. All funds in this segment are actively managed, with median fees at 0.30%. The JP Morgan Ultra-Short Income ETF (JPST) costs about half that, 0.18%. In 2018, JPST took in $5 billion in flows, beating out the segment leader PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF (MINT).Strategic VTV and active JPST are emblematic of their strategy types, as illustrated in the table below. Strategic, so-called smart beta funds that increased their market share dropped from 0.29% to 0.21% over the past year, while active funds that increased their market share now cost 0.85% on average, 0.04% less than they did in 2017.\u00a0Fee Compression In US Equity Funds, By Investment Strategy Group\n\u00a0These complex funds are heading toward zero, albeit from a higher starting point.Cash & CoreFee compression is not the only trend driving investor behavior. During 2018, investors shifted market share toward Bogle\u2019s ideal core portfolio building blocks and classic \u201cstyle box\u201d funds, and away from funds more suited to tactical use. The shift becomes obvious when looking at the top 10 inflows and outflows.\u00a0Top 10 ETFs By Inflows\u00a0Top 10 ETFs By Outflows\n\u00a0Half of the biggest losers were tactical funds. These narrow-exposure funds hone in on a particular market or apply a targeted strategy. Think real estate, high-yield bonds, sectors or plays like momentum and low volatility. The core funds that faced outflows all have direct competitors that cost a fraction of the price.The winners, on the other hand, were overwhelmingly broad-based funds that covered a wide geography, such as the U.S., developed markets or emerging markets. These are classic buy-and-hold Bogle building blocks that form the core of portfolios across the U.S. And yes, they are cheap.Given December\u2019s corrections, it is unsurprising that ETFs that can substitute for money markets funds were a smash hit in 2018. Across the U.S.-domiciled ETF landscape in 2018, cashlike ETFs punched way above their weight, growing 18 times as fast as their starting assets under management would have suggested.\u00a02018 Performance Of US-Domiciled ETFs\n\u00a0Portfolio building blocks, whether slice-and-dice \u201cstyle box\u201d funds or wide-ranging all-in-one funds, increased their market share. The tactical funds, i.e., thematics, most \u201csmart beta\u201d and the narrow-focused funds, were left behind.Conclusion2018 saw a continuation of trends that strongly favor the consumer and threaten all but the most efficient asset management businesses. Flows tell the story of where the market is going. Last year we also saw continued fee compression, diminished opportunity for newcomers, and the dominance of core-type funds that remind us all that simple, cheap portfolios have become the new industry standard. The path to 0.00% may be longer for some product types, but the direction is clear.In this new zero-cost world, portfolios\u2014not just funds, but full asset allocations\u2014may well be available at marginal cost, or nearly nothing. That\u2019s an amazing legacy, Mr. Bogle.At the time of writing, the author held no positions in the securities mentioned. Elisabeth Kashner is director of ETF research and analytics for FactSet.

  "parag": "It may not have been a seamless transition, but the handing of the volatility baton from the iPath S&P 500 Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) to the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures ETN (VXXB) was pretty successful by any measure.As we wrote about earlier this week, after 10 years on the market, VXX had its last trading day on Tuesday, and matured on Wednesday. The exchange-traded note is no more, and anyone still holding it on Wednesday was given a lump sum payment based on VXX\u2019s net asset value at Tuesday\u2019s close.As it turns out, a whole lot of people got that payment, judging by the hundreds of millions of dollars that was left in VXX on Tuesday. Assets under management totaled almost $450 million on the final trading day, down from the $915 million in AUM the product averaged over 2018, but still a sizable sum.Either a bunch of investors didn\u2019t get the memo that VXX was maturing, or they didn\u2019t care. Either way, they were fine\u2014holders got paid on Wednesday.The Switch Of course, not everyone stayed with VXX until its last dying breath. Many swapped into VXXB, a nearly identical product from the same issuer. Assets in the replacement jumped to an all-time high of $520 million on Wednesday, more than double where they were a month ago.\u00a0AUM In VXX (Blue) & VXXB (Orange)Source: Bloomberg\n\u00a0Volume in the new ETP picked up too. On Wednesday, 21 million shares of VXXB traded hands, half of VXX\u2019s average volume in 2018 and equal to VXX\u2019s average volume in 2017.\n\u00a0Volume In VXX (Blue) & VXXB (Orange)Source: Bloomberg \u00a0It\u2019s no wonder VXXB has smoothly transitioned to being the No. 1 volatility product on the market. The ETP has all of the characteristics that made its predecessor so popular. It\u2019s issued by Barclays, has an 0.89% expense ratio, and most importantly, tracks the same S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. One new aspect is that VXXB trades on the Cboe, parent company of ETF.com, but that should have no impact on how the product works.Email Sumit Roy at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or follow him on Twitter\u00a0sumitroy2"
